# Introduction

Here is the collection of 41 problems to solve. The problems are independent
from each other so in principle you can start from any of them. However, the
problems are grouped in a special way: the first 22 problems are focused on the
main system components - machines and converters - and the system behavior, and
then the remaining problems present the four application areas (pumps,
conveyors, turbines and winches/winders). So, is it recommended first to learn
more about the components and systems and then work with the applications.

To solve the problems you need to run *DriveConstructor* and, if you are new to
this online course, use the Texbook.

# User's guide

### Main page

#### What is on the main page

Look through the textbook and the exercise book before you start.

For starting press "Select" button.

![doc-userman1](/_next/static/media/userman1.58f36527.png)

#### Tips

Right-click on the "Exercizes" menu and choose "Open Link in New Tab". Do the
same for "Textbook". Then you can have both software and the books available on
the three open pages in you browser.

![doc-userman1a](/_next/static/media/userman1a.035f88e9.png)

### Page "Select topology for your system"

Select one of the four proposed topologies by pressing the respective "New
system" button. Only two topologies are taken as examples below. The ways of
working with all the topologies are identical.

### Page "Drive train with just variable speed drive"

The main principle of DriveConstructor is that the user sets up some parameters
of the components and the software chooses suitable component candidates from
catalogues and presents them to the user (the catalogues are not possible to see
in this version of DriveConstructor).

![doc-userman2](/_next/static/media/userman2.bafa8aa1.png)

Sometimes the software proposes two candidates for some component. Then it is
necessary to choose one of them by checking the checkbox in the first column.

![doc-userman3](/_next/static/media/userman3.39261b83.png)

### Page "Drive train with voltage step down"

Transformer is a very important component taking the grid voltage down to the
level desired for the frequency converter and the machine.

![doc-userman4](/_next/static/media/userman4.61486b10.png)

By default the voltage on LV side of transformer is 650-700 V. You can choose
this to some other level as shown below. Transformer ratio recalculates
automatically. You can adjust the ratio by setting different "tappings".

![doc-userman5](/_next/static/media/userman5.b7f57836.png)

When choosing types of frequency converter and winding type of transformer, make
sure lines on the icons match each other. Avoid situations where e.g.
transformer with 3-winding is connected to frequency converter destined for
2-winding transformer...

![doc-userman6](/_next/static/media/userman6.17270c92.png)

The first two topologies above are wrong and only the third one is correct!

Note that all parameters in "System" table of the report are for system as the
whole, meaning for example the price is sum of prices of all components, the
efficiency is product of efficiencies of all components, etc.

![doc-userman15](/_next/static/media/userman15.7d9b7256.png)

### Benchmarking of systems

When the report is generated as shown below, it is possible to save the system
(all system's parameters) in "My Systems" for comparison with other system
variants. Follow the following steps:

##### STEP 1. Press "Save system"

![doc-userman7](/_next/static/media/userman7.2e828880.png)

##### STEP 2. Choose some name for the system and press "Save system"

Then your system gets saved in "My systems" under the given name.

![doc-userman8](/_next/static/media/userman8.5abb13f7.png)

##### STEP 3. Open "My systems"

Here you can see key parameters of the saved system:

![doc-userman9](/_next/static/media/userman9.919b676c.png)

To benchmark systems one needs at least two of them. To set parameters of the
second system the user should go through the main page of DriveConstructor as
described in the next steps.

##### STEP 4. Press on "DriveConstructor" in the upper left corner

![doc-userman10](/_next/static/media/userman10.0dc58b1b.png)

You come to the main page.

##### STEP 5. Choose the application you are working on ("Pumps" in our case)

##### STEP 6. Choose the system topology for the second system

![doc-userman11](/_next/static/media/userman11.10d04e00.png)

##### STEP 7. Configure the system by setting all the parameters and save it in "My systems" the same way as you did for the first system

##### STEP 8. Open "My systems"

##### STEP 9. To benchmark the two systems, check both boxes under "Select" and press "Compare"

![doc-userman12](/_next/static/media/userman12.35f6071e.png)

Then the graph appear as below:

![doc-userman13](/_next/static/media/userman13.e9718b0b.png)

Use feedback form for any comments, proposals and reporting problems to the
course developers

----------------------------------------

## EM-1. Voltage level and insulation

![doc-pm-fc-tr](/_next/static/media/pm_fc_tr.153b947a.png)

Investigate influence of the rated voltage level on size and cost of the
electric motors by working with the system consisting of a motor and a frequency
converter. Take PUMP as the application and design the drive systems for the
four sets of pump parameters:

1. *head* 200 m, *flow* 85 l/s, *efficiency* 85%, rated speed 2950 rpm;
2. *head* 200 m, *flow* 145 l/s, *efficiency* 85%, rated speed 2950 rpm;
3. *head* 200 m, *flow* 200 l/s, *efficiency* 85%, rated speed 2950 rpm.

Set motor type to *SCIM*, cooling to *IC411*, efficiency class to *IE3*,
protection to *IP21*. Design the drive system so that machine and converter
voltage is around 400 V, then 690 V, then 3300 V and, finally, 6000 V.

* \[!] Make sure you keep machine type, efficiency class, cooling, protection
  class and other parameters except voltage and power the same for all the cases
  above. Include these parameters in your report.

Record power, weight and cost of motors for the three pumps above and for the
four voltages. Present the results as a chart or a table, draw conclusions.

Can you explain the results/conclusions as the electric machines designer, in
terms of winding design (insulation, cooling)?

## EM-2. Rated speed vs weight, size, inertia

You are chief engineer responsible for powering a new conveyor. You have three
helical gearboxes available at the plant's stock: two 1-stage gears with ratios
*1:4* and *1:6*, and one 2-stage gear (ratio *1:12*). Your can buy a motor to
match the gearbox or a motor that fits speed of the conveyor without any
gearbox.

Consider two system architectures; with gearbox and without one (direct drive).

#### System 1:

![doc-cn-em-fc](/_next/static/media/cn_em_fc.a3199abb.png)

#### System 2:

![doc-cn-gb-em-fc](/_next/static/media/cn_gb_em_fc.6cdb66a9.png)

For the systems 1 and 2 above investigate influence of the gear ratio on size,
cost and inertia of electric motor.

* *Take system 1.*
  * Set conveyor drum max speed to 230 rpm and min speed to 80 rpm.
  * Torque = 9 kNm.
  * Take the machine with synchronous speed to 300 rpm @ 50 Hz.
  * Record weight, cost and inertia of the chosen motor.

* *Take system 2*.
  * Set conveyor drum speed to 230 rpm and min speed to 80 rpm.
  * Torque = 9 kNm.
  * Record speed, weight, cost and inertia of motors for the following gearbox
    ratios: *4*, *6* and *12*.

Summarize in results in a table. Explain what you see, draw conclusions. Can you
explain the results/conclusions as the electric machine designer?

*Use PM machines only!*

## EM-3. Efficiency class, lifecycle analysis

![doc-pmp-fc-em3-2](/_next/static/media/pmp_fc_EM3_2.f6458572.png)

You are a chief engineer at a plant. Consider replacement of old induction motor
(cooling IC411, protection IP21) on a centrifugal pump with either IE3 motor or
IE4 motor. The old motor has efficiency corresponding to IE2. Available grid -
400 V. The existing motor is driven by an FC.

Pump parameters: *head* 50 m, *flow* 50 l/s, *efficiency* 82%, *speed* 1450 rpm.

Operational mode of the pump:

* operation at 25% load 70% of time and at rated load - 30% of time

Find LCC (cost of ownership) for all the alternatives

* Energy price - 0,07 Euro/kWh (another variant 0,2 Euro/kWh)
* Operational time - 8000 hours/year
* Service life - 5 years (another variant 10 years)

![doc-em3-1](/_next/static/media/EM3_1.f7a44022.png)

So, there are all together eight variants to consider:

1. IE3 motor, Energy price - 0,07 Euro/kWh, Service life - 5 years
2. IE3 motor, Energy price - 0,07 Euro/kWh, Service life - 10 years
3. IE3 motor, Energy price - 0,2 Euro/kWh, Service life - 5 years
4. IE3 motor, Energy price - 0,2 Euro/kWh, Service life - 10 years
5. IE4 motor, Energy price - 0,07 Euro/kWh, Service life - 5 years
6. IE4 motor, Energy price - 0,07 Euro/kWh, Service life - 10 years
7. IE4 motor, Energy price - 0,2 Euro/kWh, Service life - 5 years
8. IE4 motor, Energy price - 0,2 Euro/kWh, Service life - 10 years

What motor (IE3 or IE4) would you choose for each of the four scenarios?

1. Energy price - 0,07 Euro/kWh, Service life - 5 years
2. Energy price - 0,07 Euro/kWh, Service life - 10 years
3. Energy price - 0,2 Euro/kWh, Service life - 5 years
4. Energy price - 0,2 Euro/kWh, Service life - 10 years

What general conclusion can you draw on dominating cost components?

## EM-4. Comparison of machine technologies

![doc-pmp-fc-em3-2](/_next/static/media/pmp_fc_EM3_2.f6458572.png)

Design drive train for a pump (*head* 50 m, *flow* 50 l/s, *efficiency* 82%,
*speed* 1450 rpm).

Operational mode of the pump:

* operation at 25% load 70% of time and at rated load - 30% of time

Try *SCIM (IE2)*, *SyRM*, *PMSM* as the motor type. Calculate Life Cycle Cost
(LCC) for each motor variant. Compare the variants on spider diagram. Consider
strong and weak sides of the technologies.

![doc-em3-1](/_next/static/media/EM3_1.f7a44022.png)

* Energy price - 0,2 Euro/kWh
* Operational time - 8000 hours/year
* Service life - 10 years

## EM-5. Protection (IP class) vs size and cost

Design drive trains for the four different applications below. Note different
environmental conditions where the electric machines will be operating and
choose correct IP class for the machines.

Set the same rated speed (300 rpm) and the same voltage (690 V) in all
applications. Set *PMSM* as the motor type.

* Case 1. Pump: dairy (for different trains)
  * H=50 m, Q=50 l/s, $$\eta$$=79 %, speed 300

* Case 2. Conveyor: cement plant
  * min speed - 100 rpm, max speed - 300 rpm, Torque - 0,9 kNm

* Case 3. Wind turbine: air conditioned compartment(nacelle)
  * Rated speed - 200 rpm, overspeed - 1,2, Torque - 1 kNm

* Case 4. Winder: Clean paper winding room
  * Drum diameter (empty) - 0,3 m, Drum diameter (full) - 0,5 m, Force - 4 kN,
    Speed of the line (rated) - 3 m/s

Record: mechanism rated power, motor designation, IP class, weight and cost of
the electric machines you have chosen for the four applications above. Make sure
you keep cooling and other "influential" parameters the same. Include these
parameters in your report. Comment on the differences between the motors chosen.

## EM-6. Cooling vs size and cost

Imagine you are chief engineer at a paper mill. Design drive train for the
winder with given characteristics:

* Drum diameter (empty) - 0,3 m,
* Drum diameter (full) - 0,6 m,
* Force - 16 kN,
* Speed of the line (rated) - 5 m/s,
* 400 V,
* flange\&foot mounting of the motor,
* cooling water 30 deg.C is available.

Make sure you keep machine type and efficiency class the same when comparing
cooling and protection class variants. Include these parameters in your report.

Solve the problem using power components with (1) air cooling, (2) water
cooling. Compare the air-cooled and water-cooled variants. Present the results
in the table.

|        | Cooling | Protection | Weight | OD | Length | Cost |
| ------ | ------- | ---------- | ------ | -- | ------ | ---- |
| Case 1 | IC411   | IP54/55    |        |    |        |      |
| Case 2 | IC416   | IP54/55    |        |    |        |      |
| Case 3 | IC411   | IP21/23    |        |    |        |      |
| Case 4 | IC71W   |            |        |    |        |      |

## EM-7. Derating for altitude and temperature

Sales manager of a big electric motor provider have received three very similar
requests from Madrid, Mexico and El Alto. In each of the requests they need
induction motor to drive a centrifugal pump with *head* 60 m, *flow* 50 l/s,
*efficiency* 83% and *rated speed* of 950 rpm. The motor is to be operated from
existing frequency converter which rated voltage of 400 V and power of 45 kVA.
Distance between the pump and the FC is 30 m. Other conditions, e.g. cooling,
are specified as well. Help the sales manager to make offers for
Madrid/Mexico/El Alto. Propose more than one alternative if needed. Include only
motors into the offers.

Important details:

* Madrid, Spain - 667 m above sea level
* Mexico, Mexico - 2240 m above sea level
* El Alto, Bolivia - 4150 m above sea level

## EM-8. Frame material vs size and cost

Choose frame material suitable for the given environment.

#### Case 1

Application - food & beverages (wet, acids, etc.)

Take CONVEYOR with drive system with just frequency converter.

![doc-cn-em-fc](/_next/static/media/cn_em_fc.a3199abb.png)

Available information:

* One drum to be driven
* No overloads, duty cycle - 100%
* Dusty environment, abundant heat removal capability, wet floor
* Grid 400 V
* Distance between the driven drum of the conveyor and the FC (cable length) -
  30 m
* Rated torque 500 Nm
* Speeds: min - 300, max - 400 rpm

#### Case 2

Application - mining (dusty, mechanical shocks)

Take WINCH with drive system with just frequency converter.

Available information:

* empty drum diameter 0.2 m
* full drum diameter 0.3 m
* linear speed at which the cable is to be reeled on the drum - 1 m/s
* force/tension on the cable 2 kN
* grid voltage 400 V
* no overloads

## EM-9. Shaft height and mounting

There is an oil pump with *Q*=55 l/s, *H*=50 m, *efficiency* 82%, *speed* 1400
rpm. Conditions:

* Clean dry room with abundant heat removal capability.
* Grid 400 V.
* Cable length - 200 m.

The plan is to replace old *SCIM* driving the pump with IE4 motor. Shaft height
of the old motor is 180 mm and the pump is fixed to the frame together with the
motor. Is the replacement possible? Consider several variants. Compare them.
First consider *SCIM* only. Then solve the problem using other motor types.

Note that density of oil is not the same as density of water.

![doc-pump-with-motor](/_next/static/media/pump-with-motor.8c1206fb.png)

## EM-10. Thermal capacity & insulation class

Design drive trains for the two identical conveyors with parameters:

* Speed 200...230 rpm
* Rated torque - 9 kNm

One conveyor has duty of 100%, another one - 80%. Grid is 690 V.

Explain the difference in chosen electric machines for the two cases.

#### Question-1

Could we have used even smaller machine on the second conveyor? If yes, what
insulation class should it have had (assume all motors in *DriveConstructor*
have insulation class *"B"*)? If we use smaller machine with the same class
*"B"* as before then what would be insulation lifetime (assume in normal load
lifetime of 10000 hours)?

#### Question-2

Is replacing the motor with insulation class *"H"* with another motor with
insulation class *"F"* possible? What lifetime should be expected? What if
insulation class *"H"* but temperature rise as for class *"F"*?


# Frequency converters

title: Frequency converters
description: Frequency converters exercises
-------------------------------------------

## FC-1. 2Q vs 4Q solutions

Design and compare drive trains for the two applications; a pump and a wind
turbine.

#### Pump

Drive train with just FC.

![doc-pm-fc-tr](/_next/static/media/pm_fc_tr.153b947a.png)

Set parameters:

* Rated flow 60 l/s, head 200 m, efficiency 81%, speed 600 rpm
* Grid voltage - 6000 V
* Clean electric room for the FC with abundant heat removal capabilities
* Distance from the electric room to the pump - 30 m

#### Wind turbine

Drive train with gearbox, FC and transformer.

![doc-wt-gb-fc-tr](/_next/static/media/wt_gb_fc_tr.ec184a37.png)

Set parameters:

* Blades rated speed 20 rpm, overspeed 1,2, torque 60 kNm, 2-stage gearbox with
  ratio 1:30
* Grid voltage - 6000 V
* Clean nacelle where the FC is installed with abundant heat removal
  capabilities

Use the same machine type (*SCIM*) in both cases and keep the same: air cooling,
electric machine voltage around 690 V

Compare: size, weight, cost, efficiency of the FC and THD of the two cases. Draw
conclusions.

## FC-2. Topologies and voltage levels

Imagine you are chief engineer at a large plant. You need to upgrade throttle
regulated pumps driven by direct online started motors to speed-controlled
systems with FC and without any throttles. You have available some motors on
stock (imagine you have any motor you may need) but need to buy the FCs.

The pumps in question have different power: 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 MW.

1. head 210 m, flow 200 l/s, efficiency 85%, rated speed 1450 rpm;
2. head 210 m, flow 400 l/s, efficiency 85%, rated speed 1450 rpm;
3. head 420 m, flow 400 l/s, efficiency 85%, rated speed 1450 rpm;
4. head 800 m, flow 500 l/s, efficiency 85%, rated speed 1450 rpm.

Rated speed is the same - 1500 rpm. Grid - 6 kV. Distance between the pump and
FC is 100 m.

Use the system topology with a transformer:

![doc-pm-fc-tr](/_next/static/media/pm_fc_tr.153b947a.png)

You have constrained budget so design the system for lowest possible cost.
Present the results in a table.

Reflect on how power level affects the choice of voltage level. Is the choice
determined by feasible cable cross-section?

Find overall system efficiencies at partial load (50%) for each of the three
systems.

Extra question: you've got MV motor with accessible terminal box which can be
connected either Y or D. When connected "Y" it can be fed 6000 V, when "D" -
3400 V. How this reconnection possibility may affect FC choice/opportunities?

## FC-3. Cooling vs weight, size and cost

Imagine you are the sales manager at a factory producing frequency converters
(FC). Answer the questions in the two requests (solve the two problems).

#### Request 1. FC for a pump

Pump parameters:

* Rated flow 50 l/s, head 200 m, efficiency 81%, speed 1450 rpm

There is available a cubicle where the FC can be potentially placed. At the
moment there is old motor starter in this cubicle to start this particular pump,
so the idea is to replace the motor started with the new FC. Cubicle dimensions
(Depth x Height x Width): 0,5 x 1,2 x 0,4 m. Cooling water is available. Will
the new FC fit the cubicle?

#### Request 2. FC for a wind turbine

There is a plan to upgrade of the WT product line from 1 to 1,5 MW. This will
require changing the blades design.

The new wind turbine: rated speed of the blades 20 rpm, overspeed 1,2, torque
750 kNm, 2-stage gearbox with ratio 1:30. Grid 6000 V.

The plan to reuse the same nacelle. Place available for the new FC (footprint 6
m2, volume 4m3) remains the same as in the 1 MW nacelle. Former 1 MW drive train
was air-cooled. It is decided to arrange water cooling, so air-to-water heat
exchanger will be available (installed in the tower). Will the new 1,5 MW FC fit
the available place?

![doc-fc3](/_next/static/media/FC3.70c0e4a8.png)

## FC-4. Derating for altitude and temperature

You have three requests which look identical from Madrid, Mexico and El Alto. In
each of the request they need frequency converter to drive 45 kW induction motor
driving a pump (centrifugal pump with head 60 m, flow 50 l/s, efficiency 83% and
rated speed of 950 rpm). The motor is drawing current of 40 A at a voltage of
400 V. Distance between the pump and the FC is 30 m. Other conditions are
specified as well. Make offers for Madrid/Mexico/El Alto. Propose more than one
alternative if needed. Include only FC into the offers.

Important details:

* Madrid, Spain - 667 m above sea level
* Mexico, Mexico - 2240 m above sea level
* El Alto, Bolivia - 4150 m above sea level

Additional question: Can we compensate high altitude with lower temperature of
the coolant?

## FC-5. Influence of overloads on design

Design drive trains for the six different conveyors. Each conveyor is to be
driven by one motor. System topology is the same for all the conveyors: gearbox
*1:5* (type: helical). Grid voltage is 400 V.

![doc-cn-gb-em-fc](/_next/static/media/cn_gb_em_fc.6cdb66a9.png)

Parameters (the same for all the conveyors):

* torque 10 kNm, speeds: min - 100 rpm, max - 200 rpm.

The difference between the conveyors is in the overload patterns according to
the table below. Conveyors 1-4 have overload due to technological processes.
Conveyors 5 and 6 have overload due to heavy start. Reflect on motor thermal
cycling.

| Overloads | 1                 | 2                | 3                 | 4                | 5             | 6              |
| --------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Amplitude | 10%               | 10%              | 50%               | 50%              | 100%          | 100%           |
| Duration  | 1 min each 10 min | 1 min each 2 min | 1 min each 10 min | 1 min each 2 min | 2 s each 60 s | 10 s each 60 s |
| FC type   |                   |                  |                   |                  |               |                |
| FC price  |                   |                  |                   |                  |               |                |
| EM type   |                   |                  |                   |                  |               |                |
| EM price  |                   |                  |                   |                  |               |                |

## FC-6. Mounting and protection

description: Drive systems exercises
------------------------------------

## SYS-1. Rated speed vs weight, size & cost

For the system driving a pump and consisting of a motor and a frequency
converter investigate how chosen rated speed of the machine affects it's weight,
size and cost.

![doc-pmp-fc-em3-2](/_next/static/media/pmp_fc_EM3_2.f6458572.png)

Design the system with the following parameters:

* Pump: rated flow 100 l/s, head 110 m, pump efficiency 86%, speed 1050 rpm,
* Motor type SCIM, cooling IC411,
* Grid voltage 400 V.

First choose machine with the synchronous speed of 1000 rpm. Record weight and
cost of motor and of frequency converter.

As the alternative variant choose machine with synchronous speed of 1500 rpm.
Record weight and cost of motor and of frequency converter.

Compare weights and costs of the two motors (1000 and 1500 rpm), then compare
costs of the two systems. Draw conclusions and explain. Can you explain the
results/conclusions as electric machine designer?

* \[!] Make sure you keep machine type, efficiency class, cooling, protection
  class and other "influential" parameters constant (the same). Include these
  parameters in your report.

## SYS-2. Design for short and wide speed ranges

The chief engineer is to design drive system for the three similar conveyors
with different operational speed ranges. Available information (common for the
three conveyors):

* One drum to be driven
* Gearbox: helical 1-stage, ratio 1:5
* No overloads, duty cycle - 100%
* Air-conditioned clean power house, abundant heat removal capability
* Distance between the driven drum of the conveyor and the FC (cable length) -
  30 m
* Grid 400 V
* Rated torque 5 kNm
* Cooling: cooling water is not available. Consider the two air-cooling
  variants: (a) IC411, (b) IC416

Difference between the conveyors: speeds (min-max)

* 1 case: 40 - 200 rpm (wide speed range)
* 2 case: 180 - 200 rpm (narrow speed range)
* 3 case: 180 - 206 rpm (overspeed)

Help the chief engineer to design the three systems. Record weight and cost of
motor and of frequency converter for each case. Draw conclusions and explain.
Can you explain the results/conclusions as electric machine designer? Converter
designer? System designer?

title: Wind and tidal turbines
description: Wind and tidal turbines exercises
----------------------------------------------

## WT-1.Top head mass reduction for floating wind turbines

Two imaginary companies, *OffshoreWinds Ltd* and *WindFloaters Inc* develop
offshore floating wind turbines of 1 and 2 MW size, respectively. Help them to
design power drive trains for their turbines. You are free to place converter
and transformer in the tower if you like. Available tower diameter is 4 m for
the 1 MW turbine and 7 m for the 2 MW turbine (remember space for the
elevator!).

Parameters of the turbines:

* Turbine by *OffshoreWinds Ltd*: Power 1 MW, rated speed 17 rpm.
* Turbine by *WindFloaters Inc*: Power 2 MW, rated speed 15 rpm.

Inter-park voltage is 11 kV.

What cables will you use? How about cable connection terminals? Bending of the
cable? Do you get some advantage if tower and nacelle are air-conditioned (no
salty air penetration)? What if clean cooling water is made available in the
nacelle/tower? What are other/additional design steps which cannot be tried in
DriveConstructor would you try? Input from the company: "we need lowest possible
top head mass as it would simplify design of the floating tower"

Note: We did not include direct drive option here as it is known to be the
heaviest.

Hints:

* Low-voltage electric machines in *DriveConstructor* are available up to 2000
  kW, medium-voltage - up to 5 MW

## WT-2.Drive train optimization for on-land wind turbine

Design drive train for the series of WT;

* 500 kW (20 rpm, 238 kNm),
* 1 MW (17 rpm, 562 kNm), and
* 3 MW (15 rpm, 1910 kNm).

Overspeed is the same for all the turbines - 1.2. Grid voltage - 10000 V. Height
of the turbine is 100 m. The distance between the turbine foundation and the
power house is 200 m.

Design for lowest cost.

Try different electric machines and different gear ratios. Try different
variants with placement of the drive train components.

Assume enough space inside the tower to place the FC and the transformer (50 m
above the ground). Include variant with FC and transformer in a container on the
ground next to the WT (see the sketch below).

Assume cost of 1 m 10 kV cable is 10 euro. Assume cost of the container is 5000
euro.

Summarize and present all key results in a table.

![doc-wt2](/_next/static/media/WT2.4e500524.png)

## WT-3. Inertia of the drive train as protection against tidal turbine runaway

Consider the following situation: 1 MW TT tidal turbine (TT) is running at its
rated speed of 11 rpm (868 kNm).

There occurs grid loss, generator torque drops to zero, propeller begins to
accelerate. Brake will be applied in 0,1 sec (Case 1) or in 0,2 sec (Case 2).

Question: to what speed would the TT accelerate in Cases 1 and 2 if it had the
following drive trains configurations:

* without gear (DD),
* with 1-stage gearbox,
* with 2-stage gearbox,
* with 3-stage gearbox?

For all cases there is used PM machine as the generator.

Note: it is known that inertia of rotor of DD electric machine would be 17
$$ton\*m^2$$

## WT-4. Cost of Energy (COE) analysis for ocean and river water stream turbines

Propose optimal drive train designs for one ocean and one river water stream
turbines of 1 MW power targeting lowest COE for each of the turbines.

Given for both turbines:

* Grid on-shore voltage - 6 kV
* Rated speed - 11 rpm
* Rated torque - 870 kNm
* Overspeed - 1.2
* Grid voltage on-shore - 10 kV
* Capital expenditures (CAPEX), except of the drive train cost - 7 million Euro.
* Operational expenditures (OPEX) - 0.4 million Euro per annum for drive train
  with 3-stage gearbox, 0.39 million Euro per annum for drive train with 2-stage
  gearbox
* Lifetime of the turbine - 20 years
* Cost of 10 kV subsea cable is 10000 Euro per km

Loads of the ocean turbine:

* Close to 100% load 10% of time
* Close to 75% load 35% of time
* Close to 50% load 30% of time
* Close to 25% load 25% of time

Load of the river turbine is assumed 100% all the time.

Try the two system solutions:

* Solution 1. Frequency converter and transformer - on the shore.
* Solution 2. Frequency converter and transformer in the nacelle.

Length of the cable between the river turbine and the on-shore grid is 0,5 km.

Length of the cable between the ocean turbine and the on-shore grid is 1 km
(case 1) and 3 km (case 2).

Present the COE values for all the cases you have analyzed. Compare the ocean
and the river turbines, draw conclusions.

## WT-5. Small high-speed WT

Given characteristics of the wind turbine:

* rated blade rotation speed - 200 rpm,
* rated torque - 1 kNm,
* turbine's height (H) - 30 m,
* grid/connected transformer with 400 V low-voltage winding is available in the
  powerhouse close to the turbine,
* distance from the turbine's tower to the powerhouse (L) - 50 m.

The task: design systems for the following drive trains configurations:

1. without gear (DD),
2. with 1-stage gearbox,
3. with 2-stage gearbox.

Design for highest efficiency at rated (100%) load. Limit system cost (capital
expenditures, CAPEX) to 20000 Euro. Keep in mind that different types of gear
stages you choose have different efficiency. Try different cable materials and
cross-sections. Draw conclusions on efficiency vs cost for each of the three
system variants. Which system is the most efficient and is still under 20000
Euro in cost? Which system is the lightest? Which is the cheapest? First take
induction machine (SCIM) and try different efficiency classes, then try SyRM and
PMSM.

* Vessel grid voltage 690 V

Typical situation is given:

* Speed of the vessel - 5 m/s
* Wire elasticity - 1% (how much it can extend in % before collapsing)
* Wire length 1 km
* Inertia of the drum - 100 kgm2
* Torque is removed by control system 1 second after the net stuck detection.
* Force on the wire (and torque) increases by 20% right after the net stuck and
  them increases by 10% for every 0.1% of extension of the wire.

Design drive train so that the wire does not collapse. To find the answer try to
dimension the drive train using several gearbox and machine combinations. Check
if the wire would collapse in each design variant.

What is DriveConstructor?

title: Introduction
description: What is DriveConstructor?
--------------------------------------

*DriveConstructor* is the online educational software. It was created to support
professors teaching design of power conversion systems. It is possible to use
the software for sketching solutions for the real world problems. However, it
was developed first of all for the educational purposes. The software together
with the Textbook and the [Exercise books](/docs/exercises) form the integral
online course in power conversion system design. The knowledge can be acquired
in a structured way through solving the tasks proposed in the
[Exercise books](/docs/exercises).

A task can be for example driving a mechanism, like pump or conveyor, by using
electric power from the grid. Such a task requires conversion of the energy from
electric into mechanical whereby the electric machine, being the "heart" of the
power conversion system, works as a motor. Another example of a task can be
delivering power extracted from the water flow by a tidal turbine into the grid;
here conversion takes place from mechanical energy into electric energy whereby
the electric machine works as a generator.

The system between the mechanism and the grid can include various components;
both electrical, such as frequency converters and transformers, and mechanical,
such as gearboxes. The components, put together into the power conversion
system, can be called a drive train or a drive system (this is, by the way, why
this online software is called *DriveConstructor*)

![doc-dc-main-picture](/_next/static/media/DC_main_picture.8f19fd35.png)

Providers of the equipment often call the tasks *Applications*.

In *DriveConstructor* it is possible to design systems for the four
applications: [pumps](/docs/textbook/applications/pumps), conveyor, winch (or
winder) and wind (or tidal) turbine. The applications have different load
profiles and operational modes.

Navigating through the Textbook and solving the tasks one can learn how to
specify the mechanisms and the system components for the proposed applications
and how to design optimal systems.

# Pumps

## title: Pumps

## General description

A pump can be specified by its type and the set of hydrodynamic parameters;
rated speed, head, flow, efficiency and density of the fluid it pumps. However,
what dimensions the drive system is torque on shaft of the pump and the shaft's
rated speed as well how the torque changes with the changing speed.

To configure the drive train for a pump DriveConstructor uses four parameters:

1. Required rated torque on the shaft of the pump
2. Rated rotational speed of the pump's shaft
   * variable speed drive allows changing speed the pump operates at, however, a
     pump is designed for some definite rated speed usually given for any pump
     in the respective brochure or catalogue
3. Load curve of the pump
4. Starting torque of the pump

The load curve and starting torque of the pump depend on the pump's type. There
exist many different types of pumps. The most common - centrifugal pump - is
presented in Fig.1. Another example - progressive cavity pump - is presented in
Fig.2.

![doc-centrifugal-pump](/_next/static/media/centrifugal-pump.c143b82d.png)

*Fig.1. Centrifugal pump.*

![doc-progressing-cavity-pump](/_next/static/media/progressing-cavity-pump.bdacad07.png)

*Fig.2. Progressing cavity pump with a motor.*

Rated rotational speed of the pump's shaft is given for any pump in the
respective brochure or catalogue.

### Rated torque

Rated torque is calculated from the power and the speed:

$$T = (9.55\*P)/n$$,

where $$n$$ is speed in rpm, $$P$$ is power in kW and $$T$$ is torque in kNm.

The power can be calculated from pump parameters such as head, flow, efficiency
and density of pumped fluid:

$$P=(g\*\rho*h*q)/(3.6*10^6*\eta)$$,

where $$P$$ is in kW, $$g$$ is gravity ($$g=9.81$$ $$m/s^2$$), $$\rho$$ is
density of the pumped fluid in $$kg/m^3$$, $$\eta$$ is efficiency of the pump,
$$h$$ is head in m and $$q$$ is flow in $$m^3/h$$.

Note that in practice a pump can work at heads and flows lower than the rated
ones for which it is designed. Speed and efficiency can then be different from
the rated ones as well. So, remember to enter actual head, flow, speed and
efficiency.


# Pump types and load curves
URL: /docs/textbook/applications/pumps/pump-types

undefined

***

## title: Pump types and load curves

Pumps can be classified by their method of the fluid displacement. There are
many classifications, one of them is presented in Fig. 1.

![doc-pumps-classification](/_next/static/media/pumps-classification.3b53eb84.png)

*Fig.1. Pump classification.*

There are two basic types of pumps: positive displacement and centrifugal
(rotodynamic). Load curves (torque-speed characteristics) of these two types of
pumps are different:

* Centrifugal pumps have quadratic load curve (QT) $$T \sim n^2$$ (Fig.2)
* Positive displacement pumps have constant load (CT) curve $$T \sim const$$ (Fig.3)

![doc-pump-curve-qt](/_next/static/media/pump-curve-QT.bd3a0717.png) *Fig.2. QT curve.*

![doc-pump-curve-ct](/_next/static/media/pump-curve-CT.61ad8cc3.png) *Fig.3. CT curve.*

Quadratic loads are often approximately represented by assuming that the torque
required is proportional to the square of the speed, giving rise to the terms
square-law load.

Key parameters of pumps description

title: Key parameters of pumps
description: Key parameters of pumps description
------------------------------------------------

## Head and flow

Rated head and flow are the key characteristic of any pump and is always
specified by the pump manufacturer.

The static Head (H) of a pump is the maximum pressure it can deliver (height to
which the pump lifts the liquid). In DriveConstructor this parameter is entered
in m.

Flow (Q), also referred to as volume flow rate or capacity, is the volume of
liquid that travels through the pump in a given time (measured in liter per
second of cubic meter per hour). Rated flow is the key characteristic of any
pump and is always specified by the pump manufacturer. In DriveConstructor this
parameter is entered in $$m^3/h$$ or $$l/s$$.

![doc-pump-and-resistance-curve](/_next/static/media/pump-and-resistance-curve.ce2c628c.png)

*Fig.1. Centrifugal pump and system resistance curves.*

| Fluid                 | Density, kg/m3 |
| --------------------- | -------------- |
| water                 | 1000           |
| average oil           | 920            |
| kerosene              | 820            |
| milk                  | 1035           |
| average oil sea water | 1025           |
| gasoline              | 720            |

### Starting torque ("breakaway" torque)

Real pumps can have a significant static friction or breakaway torque (as shown
in Fig. 2, 3), which must be overcome when starting. In some cituations starting
torque can be higher than the rated torque even for centrifugal pumps.

![doc-pump-curves-ct-bt](/_next/static/media/pump-curves-CT-BT.bd5e1c45.png) *Fig.2. Pump with CT
load curve and starting curve.*

![doc-pump-curves-stiction](/_next/static/media/pump-curves-stiction.3657666b.png) *Fig.3. Pump with
QT load curve and starting curve.*

In *DriveConstructor* starting torque is defined as the fraction of rated torque
$$T\_r$$. The following values can be chosen: 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ..., 1.8,
1.9, 2.


# Conveyors
URL: /docs/textbook/applications/conveyors

undefined

***

## title: Conveyors

Conveyors are used in various industries: metallurgical, petrochemical, mining,
glass, brewing, textile, food, printing, furniture, machinery, coal, as well as
many others. In a conveyor one or more drums (rollers) can be driven by
motor(s). Fig. 1-2 below show designs with one motor per drum. Mutual position
of the axle of the driven drum and the motor shaft are defined by the gearbox
type. There can be an angle between the axles if bevel gear stage or worm gear
stage is used.

![doc-motor-gear-drum](/_next/static/media/motor-gear-drum.0bdb8eeb.png) *Fig.1.*

![doc-conveyor](/_next/static/media/conveyor.7e67b8b2.png) *Fig.2.*

See also:

* [Duties and overloads](/docs/textbook/applications/conveyors)

### Benefits of VSD for conveyors

Equipping conveyor with variable speed drive (VSD) (motor and frequency
converter) provides a number of advantages:

*a) Improving the process controllability*

The automatic control system of the frequency converter can maintain constant
load or constant speed regardless of the load. Conveyor's control system may be
integrated in the automation system of higher level.

*b) Energy savings*

Load of some conveyors, such as e.g. the belt conveyor at coal mines and
ore-processing enterprises are quite difficult to predict because of the varying
demand of the transportation. Idling or modes close to it can reach 20-40% of
the operating time of the conveyor. The use of VSD provides smooth control of
the belt speed, maximizes energy savings under variable loads, regardless of the
profile of transport distribution.

*c) High starting torque*

The frequency converter provides high starting torque (up to 200% of the nominal
value). In the event of an emergency stop it is not necessary to unload the
conveyor because a high starting torque gives the possibility to even start a
fully loaded conveyor.

*g) Less wear of the mechanical parts and switching equipment at start*

Stepless speed increase when starting the conveyor protects the mechanical parts
from wear and prolongs service life. Soft-start is also favorable for the power
switching equipment and the mains.

*d) Increased line speed*

Using a frequency converter allows the conveyor to operate at speeds above par,
if required by the process.

*e) Load balancing on motors, shaft synchronization*

If the conveyor is provided with two or more motors, there is a need for load
balancing between the engines and the synchronization of their shafts. Modern
frequency converters have a software that allows you to implement these
functions.

## Parameters of conveyors

In *DriveConstructor* we operate with the type of curves shown in Fig.1. We
assume torque is constant in the given speed range. Short-term overload can be
specified. Also very short-term overloads for starting the conveyor (breakaway
torque) can be specified.

![doc-conveyor-curves](/_next/static/media/conveyor-curves.06c1fda3.png) *Fig.1.*

So, one needs to specify:

* minimum and maximum rotational speed of the conveyor drum,
* rated torque,
* overload torque,
* starting (breakaway) torque, and
* conveyor duty

# Wind and tidal turbines
URL: /docs/textbook/applications/turbines

undefined

***

## title: Wind and tidal turbines

Drive train of wind or tidal turbine in most cases include a gearbox and a
generator (Fig.1). The gearbox and the generator can be mechanically integrated.
Direct drives are usually bulky and heavy. There are, though, special designs
usually based on integration with the turbine structure, in order to reduce
weight.

![doc-wind-turbine-1](/_next/static/media/wind-turbine-1.497151c8.png)

*Fig.1. Wind turbine with a gearbox and a generator.*

The nacelle of a wind or a tidal turbine can contain not only the gearbox and
the generator, but also other equipment (Fig. 2-3), like frequency converter and
transformer.

![doc-wt-nacelle](/_next/static/media/wt-nacelle.70c0e4a8.png) *Fig.2. Equipment in the nacelle.*

![doc-tidal-turbine-1](/_next/static/media/tidal-turbine-1.8049972d.png) *Fig.3. Tidal turbine.*

### Load characteristics

There is theoretical maximum power which is possible to extract following the
maximum torque curve shown in Fig. 3-4. It can be seen that generator speed
increases in Region II and is kept almost constant in Region III.

![doc-wt-gen-torque](/_next/static/media/wt-gen-torque.d994217e.png) *Fig.4. Generator speed vs
torque.*

![doc-wt-gen-power-speed](/_next/static/media/wt-gen-power-speed.d7e07301.png) *Fig.5. Wind speed vs
turbine speed and power.*

There should be kept some safety torque margin (between $$n\_1$$ and $$n\_2$$ in
Fig.6) due to possible wind gusts.

![doc-wind-curve-1](/_next/static/media/wind-curve-1.dc43b14a.png) *Fig.6. Turbine load torque
curve.*

### Parameters of wind (or tidal) turbine

* Rated speed of the propeller (above this speed maximum energy is extracted)
* "Cut off" speed, which is maximum allowed speed (turbine and generator are not run above this speed)
* Rated torque (at this torque maximum energy is extracted)
* Extra torque (torque margin) is needed to prevent runaway of the turbine in case of wind gusts and very strong wind in general.


# Winches and winders
URL: /docs/textbook/applications/winches

undefined

***

## title: Winches and winders

In *DriveConstructor* two types of mechanisms are united under the same
"application" class; these mechanisms are winches (Fig. 1-2) and winders (Fig.
3\).

![doc-winch-1](/_next/static/media/winch-1.8e2d9fd2.png) *Fig.1. Winch example.*

![doc-marine-winch](/_next/static/media/marine-winch.cec2b196.png) *Fig.2. Winch example 2.*

![doc-winder](/_next/static/media/winder.d1659142.png) *Fig.3. Winder example.*

The winches and winders are characterized by the special shape of load curves.
The specifics is in changing diameter of the surface on which the material is
coiled on. The two extreme states are shown in Fig.4:

* drum without anything coiled/wound on it ($$D\_1$$)
* last layer of rope or whatever coiled/wound on the drum when there is no more
  space on it ($$D\_2$$)

![doc-winch2](/_next/static/media/winch2.dc31b1db.png) *Fig.4. Dimensions.*

![doc-winch-curves](/_next/static/media/winch-curves.536a3c30.png) *Fig.5. Load curves.*

When the coiling/uncoiling (winding/unwinding) takes place (between the two
extreme states) the speed and the torque change in the opposite way. When linear
speed and tension are kept constant, then the rated torque curve is like the
blue curve in Fig. 5. Possible overloads are presented as the dashed red curve.

#### Parameters of winches and winders

* Diameter \[m] of the drum without anything coiled/wound on it.
* Diameter \[m] of the last layer of rope or whatever coiled/wound on the drum
  when there is no more space on it.
* Rated linear force (tension) \[kN] on the line/wire/string/fabric/paper/foil or
  whatever else is being coiled/wound on the drum.
* Rated linear speed \[m/s] of the line/wire/string/fabric/paper or whatever else
  is being coiled/wound on the drum.
* Expected overload torque as multiple of the rated torque.

---------------------------------

## What is included

Only rotating AC machines with cylindrical cores with inner rotor are included
into this version of *DriveConstructor*. It is possible to choose between:

* *SCIM* - Squirrel Cage Induction Machine (Fig.1),
* *SyRM* - Synchronous Reluctance Machine (Fig.2),
* *PMSM* - Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (rotor shown in Fig.3).

![doc-scim](/_next/static/media/SCIM.bb0f79df.png) *Fig.1A. SCIM*.

![doc-scim-simple1](/_next/static/media/scim_simple1.57f62833.png) *Fig.1B. icon of SCIM*.

![doc-pm-motor-simple1](/_next/static/media/pm_motor_simple1.86f54393.png) *Fig.3B. icon of PMSM*.

SCIM, PMSM and SyRM can be selected for any application and any drive train
topology. SyRM are available for quite limited range of powers. So far only LV
SyRM products are known, therefore only LV FC can be used to drive SyRM.

Performances of the machines of different types are different. Usually:

* Efficiency (SCIM) \< Efficiency (SyRM) \< Efficiency (PMSM)
* Cost (SCIM) \< Cost (SyRM) \< Cost (PMSM)
* Size (SCIM) > Size (SyRM) > Size (PMSM)

## Key parameters of electric machines

#### Rated power

Power rating of the electric machines available in *DriveConstructor* is
according to IEC 60072-1 which suggests the following preferred ratings (based
on a subset of the R40 series) for motors (in kW) and generators (in kVA):

![doc-em-rated-powers](/_next/static/media/EM_rated_powers.15cb0992.png)
[Source: IEC](http://www.openelectrical.org/wiki/index.php?title=Standard_IEC_Ratings)

Note that asterix-marked powers are "secondary series" ratings and are only to
be used in cases of special need.

In *DriveConstructor* we use the following series of powers (in kW): 1.1, 1.5,
2.2, 3, 4, 5.5, 7.5, 11, 15, 18.5, 22, 30, 37, 45, 55, 75, 90, 110, 132, 160,
200, 250, 280, 315, 355, 400, 450, 500, 560, 630, 710, 800, 900, 1000, 1250,
1400, 1600, 2000, 2500, 3150, 4000.

Our list is shorter than the IEC one as we picked up only the most used powers.

#### Rated voltage

Electric machines may be designed for different supply voltages (from converter
or grid). Machines are usually designed for "standard" ranges of rated voltage,
e.g. 380-400 V or 650-700 V, as it is easier to connect a "standard" machine to
a typical grid or a "standard" frequency converter. In Europe and America the
standard ranges are different. In Europe it is usual to differentiate between
*LV* (below 1 kV) and *MV* (above 1 kV).

In *DriveConstructor* the range of rated voltages to which the machine is
designed to operate within can be chosen from the following options: 380-440,
650-700, 3200-3400, 5900-6700, 9000-12000 V. If it is desirable that the voltage
is chosen automatically then choose "any". It is assumed that all machines are
*Y*-connected. In practice windings can be reconnected into *D*, but this option
is not included.

Machines designed for lower voltage are usually smaller, lighter and cheaper
than those designed for MV. This is because of thinner insulation in the slots,
which allows putting more copper in the slots and makes heat removal easier.

It is normally not possible to design LV machines for very high powers as
currents would become too high and cables would become too thick to be
practical. LV machines are normally produced for powers from fractions of kW up
to a few MW (in *DriveConstructor* up to 2 MW), MV machines - from about 0,2 MW
to 10...20 MW (in *DriveConstructor* up to 5 MW), in some cases up to 100 MW!

Slot designs of LV and MV machines look quite different:

![doc-lv-slot](/_next/static/media/LV_slot.dea01f49.png) *Fig.4. LV slot.*

![doc-hv-slot](/_next/static/media/HV_slot.b308432e.png) *Fig.5. HV slot.*

#### Rated synchronous speed

Rated synchronous speed is proportional to supply frequency and reverse
proportional to number of poles ($$n=120\*f/p$$). For 50 Hz supply and number of
poles 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 rated synchronous speed is 3000, 1500, 1000, 750 and
600, respectively.

SCIM have slip, so its rated speed is lower than rated synchronous speed by a
few percent. SyRM and PMSM have rated speed equal rated synchronous speed.

It is obvious that a machine designed for delivering high power is bigger than a
machine designed for delivering low power. It is less obvious that the rated
speed the machine is designed for affects it's weight, compactness, rotor
inertia and cost. However, if the power is fixed, the machine with lower speed
will have higher torque ($$T\sim P/n$$). To be able to provide higher torque the
machine has to be larger, heavier and as the consequence more expensive.

## Efficiency class

The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has developed an
internationally applicable testing Standard IEC 60034-2-1 for electric motors
and a classification scheme IEC 60034-30-1 with four levels of motor efficiency
("IE-code"):

* IE1 Standard efficiency,
* IE2 High efficiency,
* IE3 Premium efficiency
* IE4 Super premium efficiency.

The IE-code and its efficiency levels create a basic vocabulary for governments
to determine the efficiency level for their minimum energy performance standards
(MEPS). The European Union sets motor MEPS levels (Directive 640/2009) at IE3
(or IE2 in combination with a variable frequency drive) from 2015 for smaller
motors and from 2017 covering also larger motors.

![doc-efficiency-class1](/_next/static/media/Efficiency_class1.dc217a55.png)

*Fig.6. Cut-away of standard, energy-efficient, and premium efficiency motors.*

Efficiency value for a certain class depends on power as shown on the diagram
below:

![doc-efficiency-class3](/_next/static/media/Efficiency_class3.81a07637.png)

*Fig.7. Efficiency classes for 4-pole motors.*

Efficiency at partial load (e.g. 25%, 50%) is lower than at rated load (100%).
High efficiency class motors are larger and heavier, while lower IE class motors
are more compact and lighter. Therefore, motors with higher IE class are more
expensive.

## Cooling

Cooling arrangements are usually chosen to minimize machine cost. Other factors,
such as the availability of cooling water, the need to minimize airborne noise,
or space limitations, may influence the eventual choice. There exist many types
(classes) of cooling. However, in *DriveConstructor* the choice is limited to
the three classes presented below:

* air-cooled self-cooled, designated *IC411*
* air-cooled forced-cooled *IC416* (forced ventilation independent from the
  shaft)
* water-cooled *IC71W*

![doc-cooling1](/_next/static/media/Cooling1.d52a2342.png) *Fig.8. IC411*.

![doc-cooling2](/_next/static/media/Cooling2.d6dd5cde.png) *Fig.9. IC416. Note separate motor for
driving the fan*.

![doc-cooling3](/_next/static/media/Cooling3.eaba7059.png) *Fig.10. IC71W. Note the cooling mantle*.

Fig. 11 shows that *IC416* provides more load capacity at low speeds than
*IC411*. It is because the independently fed fan motor of *IC416* configuration
allows maintaining the cooling air flow independently on the rotor speed.

![doc-cooling-411-vs-416](/_next/static/media/cooling_411_vs_416.4b0b7834.png) *Fig.11. IC411 vs
IC416*.

Water-cooled machines can be 20-40% smaller than air-cooled IP54/55 machines. If
cooling water is available, some economies in motor size can be obtained by the
use of water-cooling.

## Mechanical design

#### Mounting variants

There are three basic variants of mounting included in *DriveConstructor*: B3 -
foot-mounted, B5 - flange-mounted, B35 - machine with both feet and flange. The
difference between mounting variants is reflected in price. Flange-mounted
machine would have 1-3% higher price and flange\&foot-mounted - by 5%, compared
to the basic foot-mounted design.

![doc-em-mounting1](/_next/static/media/EM_mounting1.f8a4e8ad.png) *Fig.12. B3*

![doc-em-mountingb5](/_next/static/media/EM_mountingB5.11607a7e.png) *Fig.13. B5*

![doc-em-mountingb35](/_next/static/media/EM_mountingB35.c8dd49b1.png) *Fig.14. B35*

#### Shaft height

IEC and NEMA has standardized motor dimensions, including shaft height.

![doc-shaft-height](/_next/static/media/Shaft_height.07025955.png) *Fig.15. Shaft height
illustration.*

Standard shaft heights row in mm: 56, 63, 71, 80, 90, 100, 112, 132, 160, 180,
200, 225, 250, 280, 315, 355, 400, 450, 500, 560, 630, 710. If the shaft height
of the driven mechanism is set, then it can be beneficial to choose electric
machine with the same or close shaft height to simplify coupling of the motor
and the mechanism. If the shaft height of the driven mechanism is unknown then
for the electric machine "any" can be chosen instead of some concrete value.
Shaft height is approximately equal to half the diameter (*h=OD/2*).

#### Frame material

The available frame materials are used based on their mechanical strength,
density, heat transfer capability, cost, corrosion resistance, etc. In
*DriveConstructor* it is possible to choose from Aluminum (AL), Cast Iron (CI)
and Steel (S). Some characteristics of the materials in comparison to the others
are given below:

* Aluminum

* vs CI\&S: Aluminum is almost two-three times lighter than steel or cast iron
  but several times more expensive

* vs CI\&S: Aluminum is a better heat conductor than steel or cast iron. The
  extrusion process enhances aluminum's heat conducting properties by allowing
  the frame sections to have thinner fins placed closer together. The result is
  more fins and greater surface area for maximum cooling. So, machines with
  aluminum frames will be more compact and lighter

* vs CI\&S: Machines with aluminum frames are usually cheaper and easier to
  install (because they are lighter).

* Cast iron

* vs AL: Cast iron machines don't have corrosion problems. Their frames are much
  stronger than aluminum frames, but they are heavier and harder to install.

* vs S: Cast iron is cheaper than steel

* Steel

* vs CI: The yield strength of steel is higher than the ultimate strength of
  cast iron. This makes steel much stronger and 250% more rigid than cast iron.
  Cast iron is perceived as a rugged motor frame material because of its
  bulkiness, when in reality its relatively fragile nature requires 2-1/2 times
  as much metal to approach the performance of steel. And when it comes to
  impact loads, steel provides much greater resistance to cracking.

Aluminum frames are usually used up to 60 kW, steel and cast iron frames - to MW
level.

## Insulation classes

Anyone specifying or using electric machines should have understanding of how
the insulation is related to temperature. Three classes of insulation are in
common use (with *F* being the most common):

* class *B* - with a maximum operating temperature of $$130^\circ C$$
* class *F* - with a maximum operating temperature of $$155^\circ C$$
* class *H* - with a maximum operating temperature of $$180^\circ C$$

Typically motors are designed for a maximum ambient temperature of 40
$$^\circ C$$. The difference between the average winding temperature and any hot
spot is limited and it is usual to allow a 10 $$^\circ C$$ margin for class *B*
and *F* insulation and a 15 $$^\circ C$$ margin for class *H*.

| Insulation class               | B               | F               | H               |
| ------------------------------ | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Maximum insulation temperature | $$130^\circ C$$ | $$155^\circ C$$ | $$180^\circ C$$ |
| Maximum temperature rise       | $$80^\circ C$$  | $$100^\circ C$$ | $$125^\circ C$$ |

Note that electrical machines are designed for an overall temperature rise to a
level that is below the maximum specified for the insulation materials. For
example, using class-F insulation:

max ambient + max temperature rise = $$40^\circ C + 100^\circ C = 140^\circ C$$,

which gives a thermal reserve of $$15^\circ C$$. The larger the thermal reserve,
the longer the life expectancy of the insulation material.

When operating continuously at the maximum rated temperature of its class, the
life expectancy of the insulation is about 10 years. Most machines do not
operate at such extreme conditions because an additional safety margin is
usually allowed between the calculated load torque requirements and the actual
size of the machine chosen for the application. So life expectancy of a machine,
which is correctly matched to its load and with suitable safety margins, can
reasonably be taken between 15 and 25 years. It is common practice to design
machines for class-*B* temperature rise but to actually use class-*F* insulation
materials. This provides an extra $$20^\circ C$$ thermal that will extend the
life expectancy to more than 20 years. This also means that the machine could be
used at higher ambient temperatures of up to $$50^\circ C$$ or more,
theoretically up to $$65^\circ C$$.

Running motors at a reduced temperature will also significantly extend the
useful life. For example, a machine operating at $$180^\circ C$$ will have an
estimated life of

* only 300 hours with Class *A* insulation
* only 1800 hours with Class *B* insulation
* only 8500 hours with Class *F* insulation
* tens of thousands of hours with Class *H* insulation

## title: Frequency converters

## Frequency converters general information

A typical frequency converter (FC) nowadays is a so-called voltage-source type -
over 95% of all FC are voltage-source converters (VSC). This FC type has a
DC-link with a capacitor bank across (see Fig.1).

![doc-basic-fc-2](/_next/static/media/basic_fc_2.be40892e.png) *Fig.1. VSC topology.*

The voltage of the supply network with a constant frequency and amplitude is
first rectified into DC voltage though with some ripples (Fig.2), and then it is
converted into the voltage with the required frequency and amplitude (Fig. 3).
Note that the voltage waveform is made of pulses of varying duration, wherein
the "fundamental" voltage is sinusoidal.

![doc-rectification](/_next/static/media/rectification.4979a965.png) *Fig.2. Rectified current in
the DC link.*

![doc-pwm-voltage](/_next/static/media/pwm_voltage.3b441345.png) *(a)*

![doc-pwm-current](/_next/static/media/pwm_current.c82cd231.png) *(b)*

*Fig.3. Phase voltage (a) and current (b) at the converter output (machine
side).*

Some FC theory can be found for example
[here](http://www.frequencyconverter.net/basics.html),
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-frequency_drive) and
[here](http://machinedesign.com/motorsdrives/abcs-and-1-2-3s-variable-frequency-drives).

##### FC mounting variant

Small and light FC are usually wall-mounted, while large and heavy are -
floor-mounted. In Fig.4 the smaller dark-colored FC are for wall-mounting. The
larger light-colored FC should be floor-installed. Usually FC above 250 kW can
be found in floor-mounted versions only. FC can be wall mounted when powers are
below 250 kW. Wall-mounted modules can be convenient in certain cases, e.g. FC
can be installed into existing cubicles or when the floor is wet wall mounted
design can be the only way. For some powers (usually 200...250 kW) there exists
both wall-mounted & floor-mounted versions.

***

## FC topologies

FC can be 2-quadrant (2Q) and 4-quadrant (4Q):

* 2Q FC can transfer power only in one direction - from the grid to the electric
  machine (motor),
* 4Q FC can transfer power not only from the grid to the machine but also from
  the machine (generator) to the grid.

Usually the operational mode (motoring, generating or both) of the application
defines what FC should be chosen, 2Q or 4Q. For example a wind turbine requires
4Q FC with fully-controlled inventor scheme at the grid side. Sometimes
operational requirements in applications which typically require 2Q, may require
4Q - for example large fan with high inertia may require considerable braking
capability to slow down in reasonably short time.

FC can be low-voltage (LV) and medium-voltage (MV). LV FC usually have only
2-level (2L) topology, MV - several alternative topologies (3L-NPC, SCHB, etc.).
Both the LV and MV topologies can be 2Q and 4Q.

The choice of LV or MV is usually defined by the power level, but other features
of the application, e.g. long cable can also affect the choice.

Some FC require input transformer, some don't.

As in *DriveConstructor* we deal with VSC only, all the topologies included in
the software and presented below have "VSC" in the designations.

### Converters of 2-level topology

##### 2Q-2L-VSC-6p, 2Q-2L-VSC-12p and 4Q-2L-VSC

2Q FC inventor scheme at the grid side can be 6-pulse ("6p") and 12-pulse
("12p"). Difference between "6p" and "12p" is in size, weight, cost, efficiency
and influence on the grid (THD). 4Q FC is larger, heavier, more expensive and
has lower efficiency than 2Q FC. 4Q produce lower THD in the grid. 2-level FC
are usually LV.

### Converters with 3- and multi-level topologies

##### 2Q-3L-NPC-VSC and 4Q-3L-NPC-VSC

3-level FC are usually MV. NPC stands for Neutral-Point Clamped.

## FC power, voltage and current

### Rated power

FC are rated according to
[IEC standard](http://www.openelectrical.org/wiki/index.php?title=Standard_IEC_Ratings).
The series of powers in *DriveConstructor* is 1.1, 1.5, 2.2, 3, 4, 5.5, 7.5, 11,
15, 18.5, 22, 30, 37, 45, 55, 75, 90, 110, 132, 160, 200, 250, 280, 315, 355,
400, 450, 500, 560, 630, 710, 800, 900, 1000, 1250, 1400, 1600, 2000, 2500,
3150, 4000 kW. If it is desirable that power is chosen automatically then choose
"any" - it is the default setting.

### Rated voltage

The same voltage ranges are given both for grid side and machine side of the
converter. In *DriveConstructor* the variants to choose from are: 380-440,
650-700, 3200-3400, 5900-6700, 9000-12000 V. If it is desirable that voltage is
chosen automatically then choose "any" - it is the default setting.

In *DriveConstructor* 3L-NPC topologies can have voltage rating of 2460 V, 3300
V and 4160 V, while ML-SCHB topologies - 6000 V, 6600 V, 10000 V and 11000 V.

### Currents

For almost any application it can be expected that load torque will vary with
time going up and down. The pattern can be quite unpredictable. As current drawn
from the FC is proportional to the load torque, the torque variation determines
the current variation. In some application, e.g. pumps, the variation is not
significant and can be called "low", while in other applications, e.g. conveyor
or winch, the variation can be significant, and, therefore can be called "high".
Examples of what can be called "high overloads" and "low overloads" are
presented in Fig.1.

![doc-fc-lo-ho](/_next/static/media/fc_lo_ho.659cb74a.png) *Fig.1. "High overloads" and "low
overloads"*.

Choosing the FC the designer should take this aspect into account. Each FC has
certain overload capability determined by several physical limitations such as
thermal current and maximum current. The overloads the FC can tolerate will be
characterized by a certain amplitude, duration and cycle.

The same converter can be used for "high overloads (HO)" and "low overloads
(LO)" but its rated current in a catalogue will be presented in two variants;
$$I\_H$$ and $$I\_L$$, where $$I\_L$$ is always higher than $$I\_H$$. The principle
is that motor current $$I\_m$$ should be lower than FC current. When choosing FC
for LO application, e.g. a pump, $$I\_L$$ should be used and $$I\_L$$ should be
higher than $$I\_m$$. Usually for LO applications acceptable overloads are just
10% and FC current should then handle $$1.1*I\_L$$. When choosing FC for HO
application, e.g. a conveyor, $$I\_H$$ should be used and $$I\_H$$ should be
higher than $$I\_m$$. Usually for HO applications acceptable overloads are 50%
and FC current should then handle $$1.5*I\_H$$.

Explanation is presented in Fig.10. Note $$I\_c$$ which is rated continuous
current, which is not used in practice. Short-term (10 s) high current of up to
200% of $$I\_H$$ is acceptable for any converter.

conventional FC*.

## FC cooling

Typical efficiency of the low-voltage FC is 98% meaning 2% of converted energy
is turned into heat which needs to be removed from the enclosed area. FC can be
cooled by moving air and water (air- and liquid-cooling; *AC* and *LC*). The
difference between *AC* and *LC*-cooled FC is in size and weight - higher
compactness and lower weight can be achieved by use of liquid (water) cooling.
*AC* and *LC*(=*WC*) FCs are usually priced on the same level.

Fig.1 depicts a 250 kW low-voltage FC mounted on the wall in an enclosed area
such as an electrical room.

![doc-fc-cooling-air-nat](/_next/static/media/fc_cooling_air_nat.5ee0ad00.png) *(a)*

![doc-fc-cooling-air-ac](/_next/static/media/fc_cooling_air_AC.f146ef1b.png) *(b)*

![doc-fc-cooling-air-wc](/_next/static/media/fc_cooling_air_WC.94d6809a.png) *(c)*

*Fig.11. Cooling types.*

With the efficiency of 98% the 250 kW FC will produce 5 kW of heat. To remove
the heat from the FC's heatsink a quite powerful ventilation fan should be
integrated into the FC enclosure. For the 250 kW power the volume of air pumped
through the heatsink should be in the order of 2000-3000 m3/h. Filtering may be
required if the environment is dusty or dirty. This can be a maintenance
concern.

If the produced heat is not handled (removed) in some way, eventually the
temperature within the enclosed area (ambient temperature for the FC) will
increase. Increasing the ambient operating temperature above the maximum design
temperature of the FC will cause the FC to overheat which shortens its lifetime
and will cause shutdowns. In Fig.1,a the heat is removed in a natural way, e.g.
through walls, windows, doors. This is possible if the enclosed area is large
(e.g. large production hall). In Fig.1,b the heat is removed with the help of
air conditioning. The latter measure can be costly and/or complicated to
implement.

Fig. 1,c depicts water-cooled FC with water pipes going to the neighboring room.
First, the water-cooled FC is considerably smaller (half the weight of the
air-cooled one). Secondly, the heat produced inside the FC due to losses is
divided into two parts; 90% is removed from the heat sink by the cooling water
and brought away from the enclosed area where the FC is installed, 10% are
dissipated within the enclosed area. The 10% of 5 kW of heat make just 500 W,
which can be easily dissipated without additional measures like air
conditioning. So, the largest portion of heat is removed through the liquid and
can be transferred to another media through a heat exchanger as shown in
Fig.1,c.

Liquids used in the FC primary cooling loop. Typical: drinking water,
demineralized or deionized water, and a water/glycol mixture for freeze
protection.

##### Heat exchangers

If clean cooling water is not available on site, water-to-air or water-to-water
heat exchanger may be used, providing clean water. Parameters of the heat
exchanger such as size, weight, cost and losses need to be included in the
system parameters/ performances when benchmarking alternative systems (cooling
solutions). Liquid to liquid (water-to-water) heat exchangers are used when a
cooling liquid is readily available. Liquid to air (water-to-air) heat
exchangers are used primarily when air conditioning is not desired, or in
dusty/dirty environments where air cooled VFD's can be adversely affected by
these conditions (plugged heat sinks, electronics covered in dust, complicated
maintenance routines. Challenges of water cooling: condensation, electrochemical
corrosion (mostly related to HEx)

Other factors to consider:

* Relation between cooling and IP
* Audible noise. The large fan is the primary reason air cooled FCs are noisy.
  There is no large air fan in LC FC, just a very small fans to cool the
  electronic boards

## Filters

In many cases FC should be equipped with either input or output filters. Filters
can help to solve various EMC issues on both grid side and machine side.
However, the pay is extra size, weight, cost and losses. Some MV topologies do
not require output filters. In DC it is possible to choose "choke" and
"choke+RFI" for input filter and du/dt filter and sin-filter for output filter.

### Output filters

##### SIN-filter

The LC filter, called the "sinus filter", "sine-filter" or "sin filter" (Fig. 1)
is the most efficient filter in terms of turning the current and voltage
waveforms that the FC produces into almost sinusoidal form. Fig. 2 shows an
example of the effect of a sin-filter on the shape of the voltage waveform at
the FC output. With the use of a sin-filter, virtually all the negative effects
described in chapter
[FC influence on the electric machine](../../systems/influence-machine.mdx) are
eliminated, since the machine is powered by voltage and current with a shape
very close to sinusoidal.

![doc-sin-filter-topology](/_next/static/media/sin_filter_topology.ea5b4951.png) *(a)*

*Fig. 13. The voltage waveforms at the input (a) and at the output (b) of the
sin-filter. Note different time span on the oscillograms*.

Sin-filters have certain drawbacks (largely due to the high inductance value of
its chokes):

* The voltage drop in the filter is 3-10%, depending on the manufacturer, the
  nominal power (current) of the filter and the frequency of the PWM.
* Losses of 0.5-2%. The more power, the lower the relative losses in the filter.
* Displacement of the field weakening point by 1-2 Hz towards low frequencies.
* Significant reduction (up to 20% or more) of the critical moment (overload
  capacity) of the machine.

Also it should be noted that the sine-filter is quite an expensive device. Its
cost can be up to 30-40% of the cost of the FC (at low power - up to 50-70%).

##### du/dt-filter

Structurally, the du/dt filter is a three-phase choke (Fig. 14,a), and from the
point of view of the electric circuit theory it is a concentrated inductive
resistance. The inclusion of inductance in the equivalent electrical circuit of
the cable increases the wave resistance of the cable line and brings down the
reflection coefficient. Thus, the voltage peaks at terminals decreases.

![doc-dut-filter-topology](/_next/static/media/dut_filter_topology.af799b8b.png) *(a)*

![doc-dut-filter](/_next/static/media/dut_filter.b94aba2c.png) *(b)*

*Fig. 14. "Classical" du/dt-filter topology (a) and product example (b)*.

However, the main purpose of du/dt-filters is to eliminate du/dt-effect, i.e.
decrease in the rise time of the voltage pulse. In addition, due to the inertial
properties of the inductance, the filter also reduces the voltage surge at the
leading edge of the pulse (Fig.15). The length of the cable is 30 m. Note
different rise time: dt=220 ns, dt=820 ns.

*Fig. 15. Voltage pulses at the machine terminals without du/dt-filter (a) and
with a filter (b)*.

##### Common recommendations on the use of du/dt-filters and other measures

To reduce the overvoltages, du/dt-effect and bearing currents, a whole complex
of measures is often applied, including both recommendations to machine
manufacturers, and the use of various filters, special cables, etc. The measures
depend in particular on the voltage level of the mains and on the power (size)
of the machine. Different drive manufacturers can offer different measures. One
example is presented in the table:

|                   | \< 100 kW                                                  | >= 100 kW                                                                         | >= 350 kW                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| $$U\_r\leq690 V$$ | Reinforced insulation + du/dt-filter                       | Reinforced insulation + du/dt-filter                                              | Reinforced insulation + isolated N-bearing + du/dt-filter + 1 ferrite ring                                                              |

## title: Gearboxes

A gearbox uses combinations of cogwheels to provide speed and torque conversions
from a rotating power source to another device. Each gearbox is characterized by
*gear ratio* which is defined as the input speed relative to the output speed.
Gear ratio can be related to one stage in the gearbox or to the whole gearbox if
the latter consists of more than one stage. Overall gear ratio is a product of
ratios of all stages. Also overall efficiency is a product of efficiencies of
all stages.

![doc-industrial-gearbox-free-image](/_next/static/media/industrial-gearbox-free-image.260351a7.png)
*FIg.1. Gearbox example*.

In *DriveConstructor* gearbox can have maximum three stages. However, in the
real world some gearboxes may have more than three stages.

***

When choosing a gearbox the designer should remember service factors, take
account of the number of starts, impact loading and the like. Typical procedure
of gearbox selection includes the following steps:

1. Choose gear type
2. Choose transmission ratio ("gear ratio")
3. Determine the nominal power rating of the gear unit
4. Check for maximum torque, e.g. peak operating, starting or braking torque
5. Check additional forces
6. Check thermal capacity (derating due to ambient temperature)
7. Check mounting (all parts to be lubricated should be lying in the oil or be
   splash-lubricated)

In *DriveConstructor* this procedure is present in a simplified version.

***

## Stage types

Stages may be of different types as is presented below. In one gearbox there can
be combined stages of different types.

##### Helical

Helical stage is presented in Fig.2. Gear ratios for helical gear stage can be
in the range of 1,5...10. In *DriveConstructor* we narrow the possibility to
choose from to 3...8. Efficiency of helical gear is high - usually between 97
and 98%. In *DriveConstructor* we assume rated efficiency of 98%. This type of
gear is cheap to manufacture and has good torque and noise properties, though it
is generally expensive and requires many gear stages for large reductions.

![doc-gear-helical-stage3](/_next/static/media/gear_helical_stage3.9f099e59.png) *Fig.2. Helical
stage*.

![doc-gear-worm3](/_next/static/media/gear_worm3.7d7e972c.png) *Fig.3. Worm gear*.

##### Worm gear

Worm stage is presented in Fig.3. Gear ratios for worm stage can be from 5 and
up extremely high ratios (100!). In *DriveConstructor* we narrow the possible to
choose from to 10...40. Efficiency of worm gears goes down with the increase of
the ratio (Fig.4). The possibility to have very high transmission ratios
translates into greater cost-effectiveness. Also, worm gears typically ensure
quiet, vibration-free operation. They are inherently a right-angle drive. Their
typically low efficiency suggests their use for low or middle-to-low power
demand applications and/or those featuring intermittent duty. They can be ideal
for applications that need to resist reversing.

![doc-worm-helical-eff](/_next/static/media/worm_helical_eff.fda70bca.png) *Fig.4. Efficiency of
worm gear for different ratios*.

##### Planetary gear

Planetary stage is presented in Fig.5. Gear ratios for planetary stage can be in
the range of 3...10. In *DriveConstructor* we narrow the possibility to choose
from to 4...8. Planetary gears can handle large reductions and give huge torque
capability. They have high efficiency and are very compact. At the same time
such gears are expensive to manufacture and can be noisy at high speeds.

![doc-gear-planetary-stage2](/_next/static/media/gear_planetary_stage2.3b80ca8a.png) *Fig.5.
Planetary stage*.

![doc-gear-bevel-stage2](/_next/static/media/gear_bevel_stage2.333bc2f3.png) *Fig.6. Bevel stage*.

##### Bevel gear

Bevel stage is presented in Fig.6. Gear ratios for bevel stage can be in the
range of 1,5...4. In *DriveConstructor* we limit the choice to 2...3.

***

## Combinations of stages

The stages can be put together in various combinations. Some examples are
presented below.

Gearboxes comprising several helical stages (Fig.7) are used generally in
heavy-duty applications. They are quite efficient and can have many stages.

![doc-hel-hel-hel-motor](/_next/static/media/hel-hel-hel-motor.e15f0518.png) *Fig.7. Gearbox with 3
helical stages and a motor*.

In the configuration presented in Fig.8 the input and output shafts are arranged
at right angles via a gear set with either intersecting (bevel helical) or
non-intersecting (hypoid) axes. The right-angle helical design ensures great
space efficiency in terms of width, and provides the primary alternative to worm
reducers in applications involving right angle drives. They are characterized by
high efficiency and can extend to extremely high reduction ratios (even to
1700:1).

![doc-bel-3hel](/_next/static/media/bel-3hel.9f2ef932.png) *Fig.8. 1 bevel and 1 helical stage*.

Some more examples are presented in Fig. 9-10.

![doc-worm-hel-conv](/_next/static/media/worm-hel-conv.81b5674c.png) *Fig.9. Worm gear and helical
stages for conveyor drive*.

![doc-wind-turbine-gear-plan-hel-hel](/_next/static/media/wind-turbine-gear-plan-hel-hel.5d3dd588.png)
*Fig.10. Gearbox with one planetary and two helical stages for a wind turbine.*.

![doc-plan-plan-plan-hel](/_next/static/media/plan-plan-plan-hel.81cc9734.png) *Fig.11. Gearbox with
three planetary and one helical stage for a wind turbine*.

Efficiency of any combination is the product of efficiencies of the stages,
therefore, efficiency of several stages is lower than single-stage solution.
Fig.12 presents efficiencies of some combinations of stages. Note that lower rpm
means higher gear ratio.

# Transformers

## title: Transformers

ABB claims that only small frequency converters (FC) can be connected to an LV
network without a transformer due to harmonics and EMC requirements. The
different FC types are quite diverse in the amount of produced harmonics and so
are the networks in their sensitivity. The decision whether to use an individual
supply transformer or not must be made case by case.

![doc-trafo](/_next/static/media/trafo.aa658fdc.png) *Fig.1. Transformer example.*

The supply transformer placed between the grid and the FC covers several
different tasks:

* Galvanic isolation between the frequency converter and the feeding network.
* Voltage reduction from the feeding MV or HV network to the FC input level.
* Suppression of harmonics generated by the frequency converter, thus protecting
  the feeding network from harmonic contamination.
* Protection of ambient and the feeding network against radio-frequency
  interference produced by the rapidly commutating semiconductors.

Harmonic frequencies increase the mechanical and dielectric stresses and
therefore the supply transformers must be specially designed for this duty.

***

## Power, voltages and transformation ratio

### Rated power

For transformer ratings under 10 MVA, IEC 60076-1 suggest preferred values based
on the R10 series: 10, 12.5, 16, 20, 25, 31.5, 40, 50, 63, 80, 100, and
multiples of 10n. For example, the preferred transformer sizes from 500 kVA to
4000 kVA are: 500, 630, 800, 1000, 1250, 1600, 2000, 2500, 3150, 4000.

### Voltages at higher voltage (HV) side and lower voltage (LV) side

ABB claims that the VSD supply transformer is usually fed by a medium voltage
network, but sometimes the transformer primary voltage may be at the LV level.
Feeding from an HV network is also possible but rare. The input voltages in MV
drives are from 1 kV to 36 kV. The input voltages in LV drives are usually
between 380 V and 900 V, depending on the drive type".

In *DriveConstructor* it is possible to choose not exact values but ranges of
values.

##### Voltage (HV)

The ranges can be chosen from the following: 2200-2500, 2500-2800, 2800-3200,
3200-3400, 3400-4100, 4100-4300, 4300-5800, 5800-6800, 6800-9000, 9000-12000 V.
Choose range which fits grid voltage. Default setting is "any".

##### Voltage (LV)

The ranges can be chosen from the following: 380-440, 650-700, 2400-2500,
2900-3100, 3200-3400, 4100-4200, 5900-6700 V. Choose range which fits FC
voltage. Default setting is "any".

### Transformation ratio

In *DriveConstructor* the ratio is defined by the ranges chosen for the grid
side (MaxHV-MinHV) and FC side (MaxLV-MinLV) and the additional adjustments made
manually (see the software). The range of ratios is:

* minimum ratio is calculated as MaxHV/MinLV,
* maximum ratio is calculated as MinHV/MaxLV.

Then the ratio can be "manually" adjusted within the range between minimum and
maximum values.

***

## Types of transformers

### Dry or liquid-filled

Basically, there are two distinct types of transformers: Liquid insulated and
cooled (liquid-filled type) and non-liquid insulated, air or air/gas cooled (dry
type) - see Fig. 2 and 3. Also, there are subcategories of each main type.

Liquid-filled transformers (also called oil-immersed) are normally more
efficient than dry-types, and they usually have a longer life expectancy. Also,
liquid is a more efficient cooling medium in reducing hot spot temperatures in
the coils. In addition, liquid-filled units have a better overload capability.
There are some drawbacks, however. For example, fire prevention is more
important with liquid-type units because of the use of a liquid cooling medium
that may catch fire. (Dry-type transformers can catch fire, too.) It's even
possible for an improperly protected wet-type transformer to explode. And,
depending on the application, liquid-filled transformers may require a
containment trough for protection against possible leaks of the fluid.

![doc-trafo-dry2](/_next/static/media/Trafo_dry2.6b43f554.png) *Fig.2. Dry transformer (without
enclosure).*

![doc-trafo-oil2](/_next/static/media/Trafo_oil2.cdfaad4b.png) *Fig.3. Oil-filled transformer.*

Arguably, when choosing transformers, the changeover point between dry-types and
wet-types is between 500 kVA to about 2.5 MVA, with dry-types used for the lower
ratings and wet-types for the higher ratings.

Important factors when choosing what type to use include where the transformer
will be installed, such as inside an office building or outside, servicing an
industrial load.

Dry-type transformers with ratings exceeding 5 MVA are available, but the vast
majority of the higher-capacity transformers are liquid-filled. For outdoor
applications, wet-type transformers are the predominate choice.

### Windings

Ordinary transformers have two windings; one primary and one secondary. However,
there exist three- or four-winding transformers. ABB says: "The rectifiers used
in low voltage VSDs are usually both 6-pulse or 12-pulse rectifiers, and they
may be diode bridges, thyristor bridges or power transistor solutions. The
6-pulse rectifier is supplied by a two-winding transformer and the 12-pulse
rectifier needs a three-winding transformer, having two separate secondary
windings with 30$$\degree$$ phase shift."

Special converters requiring multiple inputs call for multi-winding
transformers.

In *DriveConstructor* there are the following options: "2-winding", "3-winding",
"multi-winding".

### Cooling type

Where the dissipation of heat is an important factor, the possibility to cool
the electrical apparatus with water allows better management with the cooling
system.

### Integrated or stand-alone

Transformer can be integrated with the frequency converter or be mechanically
separated, the latter variant called "stand-alone". Integrated designs are not
common. Integration means usually sharing cooling system (heat exchanger,
cooling ducts, water piping).

# Power cables

undefined

***

## title: Power cables

![doc-power-cable](/_next/static/media/power-cable.24d4355d.png) *Fig.1. Medium voltage cable.*

### Cable parameters

#### Voltage

In *DriveConstructor* voltage rating of a cable is being chosen automatically
according to the voltage at the electric machine terminals.

#### Length

We limit the possible cable length to 5 km, so the range to choose from is 0 to
5000 m

#### Cable cross-section

Cables are produced with standard cross-sections of their phase conductors. We
can choose from the row: 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2.5, 4, 6, 10, 16, 25, 35, 50, 70,
95, 120, 150, 185, 240, 300, 400, 500, 630, 800 and 1000 $$mm^2$$.

#### Conductor material

In *DriveConstructor*, as well as in the real life, the choice should be made
between copper and aluminum cable. Some arguments are presented below.

###### Considering weight and size

For the same conductivity the weight of an aluminum cable will be only 54% of
the weight of a copper cable, but the cross-section of the aluminum cable will
be higher than that of the copper cable by 56%. So the choice will be a greater
cable cross-section or a higher cable weight. Copper cable is thinner but
heavier.

###### Considering cost

Generally speaking, aluminum cable will be cheaper. However, copper cable is
more ductile and less susceptible to electrical contact problems. Due to its
smaller cross-section, the copper cable will also be easier to install as the
stiffness of the cable depends on the square of the cross-sectional area and
thus on the fourth power of the diameter. So one should take into account the
extra cost and effort involved in installing the less pliable aluminum cables.

#### Number of runs

The surface of the cable increases not proportionally (actually slower) with
increase of the cable's cross-section, therefore, for a thicker cable heat
dissipation is less intensive and the current density should be decreased
compared to thinner ones. So, in some cases it may be more economical to have
two or more parallel thin cables (two or more "runs") with higher current
densities than one big cable with lower current density. In *DriveConstructor*
it is possible to choose number of runs from the following options: "auto", 1,
2, 4. When "auto" is chosen, *DriveConstructor* will calculate optimal number of
runs automatically.


# Grid

## title: Grid

## Grid parameters

#### Voltage

Grid voltage \[V] can be chosen from the given options.

#### Frequency

In the current version of *DriveConstructor* only 50 Hz is possible.

#### Short-circuit power

Short-circuit power \[MVA] can be chosen from the given range. It represents
"strength" of the grid. Short-circuit power is used in THD estimation.


# Altitude and derating
URL: /docs/textbook/components/altitude-derating

undefined

***

## title: Altitude and derating

When equipment is expected to work at high altitudes de-rating factors should be
applied when choosing rating of the components. At high altitudes, where there
is a reduced atmospheric pressure, the cooling of electrical equipment is
degraded due to reduced ability of the air to remove the heat from the cooling
surfaces of the machine or transformer or heat-sink of the converter. Different
equipment providers give slightly different derating factors. One possible
collection of factors is presented in tables 1 and 2. In *DriveConstructor*
derating is done automatically when the user sets the right altitude for the
components.

### Power derating

The coefficient of power derating with altitude $$k\_h$$ is defined as
permissible power output in % of rated power.

*Table 1. Power derating $$k\_h$$ as function of altitude.*

| Altitude | Electric machine & Transformer | Frequency converter | Cable |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------- | ----- |
| 1000 m   | 100%                           | 100%                | 100%  |
| 2000 m   | 92%                            | 90%                 | 99%   |
| 3000 m   | 84%                            | 85%                 | 96%   |
| 4000 m   | 76%                            | 81%                 | 90%   |

When the component needs to be de-rated for both temperature and altitude, the
de-rating factors given in the respective tables should be multiplied together.
When a component, like liquid-cooled FC, has both air- and water-cooled parts,
derating should be calculated for both parts of the respective ambient- and
coolant temperatures. In addition derating for altitude (if needed) should be
implemented. Smallest of the products $$k\_h*k\_a$$ and $$k\_h*k\_w$$ should be
taken as the overall overload.

Temperature of the coolant may help to solve the high-altitude problem for
liquid-cooled equipment - it is possible to compensate high altitude with lower
temperature of the coolant.

### Voltage derating

The coefficient of voltage derating with altitude $$k\_v$$ is defined as
permissible voltage in % of rated voltage.

*Table 2. Voltage derating $$k\_v$$ as function of altitude.*

| Altitude | Electric machine & Transformer | Frequency converter |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| 1000 m   | 100%                           | 100%                |
| 2000 m   | 90%                            | 100%                |
| 3000 m   | 80%                            | 88%                 |
| 4000 m   | 72%                            | 76%                 |

As the cable between the machine and the converter can be long (in special cases
up to several km) the altitude can be quite different for the machine and the
converter.


# Ambient and coolant temperatures
URL: /docs/textbook/components/ambient-coolant

undefined

***

## title: Ambient and coolant temperatures

When the component is expected to work at high ambient temperatures de-rating
factors should be applied when choosing rating of the machine. Different
equipment providers give slightly different derating factors. Some variants are
presented in the tables 1 and 2. In *DriveConstructor* derating is done
automatically when the user sets the ambient- or the coolant temperature for the
components.

#### Ambient temperature

As the cable between the machine and the converter can be long (in special cases
up to several km!) the environment can be quite different for the machine and
the converter, as well as for other components of the system. The machine for
example can be at the open air while the converter in a dry electric room with
air conditioning or a container (Fig.1).

![doc-container](/_next/static/media/container.114a2582.png) *Fig.1. Container example.*

The coefficient of power derating with ambient temperature $$k\_a$$ is defined as
permissible output in % of rated output as function of ambient temperature
$$T\_a$$.

*Table 1. Air-cooled components. Power derating $$k\_a$$ as function of ambient
temperature*.

| $$T\_a ^\circ C$$ | Electric machine & Transformer | Frequency converter |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| 30                | 108%                           | 102%                |
| 35                | 104%                           | 100%                |
| 40                | 100%                           | 98%                 |
| 45                | 96%                            | 92%                 |
| 50                | 92%                            | 84%                 |

When the component needs to be de-rated for both temperature and altitude, the
de-rating factors given in the table should be multiplied together.

#### Coolant temperature

Temperature of the cooling water at the input of the component cooling circuit.
In *DriveConstructor* it can be varied in the range 20...50 $$^\circ C$$ for EM,
FC and transformers. The coefficient of power derating with coolant temperature
$$k\_w$$ is defined as permissible output in % of rated output as function of
coolant temperature $$T\_w$$.

*Table 2. Water-cooled components. Power derating $$k\_w$$ as function of coolant
temperature*.

| $$T\_c ^\circ C$$ | Electric machine | Frequency converter | Transformer |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- | ----------- |
| 20                | 110%             | 105%                | 105%        |
| 30                | 108%             | 104%                | 104%        |
| 35                | 104%             | 100%                | 100%        |
| 40                | 100%             | 92%                 | 100%        |
| 45                | 96%              | 84%                 | 96%         |
| 50                | 92%              | 76%                 | 92%         |

When a component, like liquid-cooled FC, has both air- and water-cooled parts,
derating should be calculated for both parts of the respective ambient- and
coolant temperatures. In addition derating for altitude (if needed) should be
implemented. Smallest of the products $$k\_h*k\_a$$ and $$k\_h*k\_w$$ should be
taken as the overall overload. For example if $$k\_h$$=90% and $$k\_a$$=80%, the
product $$k\_h\*k\_a$$ is 0.9\*0.8=0.72 or 72%.

Temperature of the coolant may help to solve the high-altitude problem. It is
possible to compensate high altitude with lower temperature of the coolant.

There is also PWM frequency derating, though this functionality is not included
in *DriveConstructor*.


# Protection
URL: /docs/textbook/components/protection

undefined

***

## title: Protection

Equipment can be installed in quite demanding environments (e.g. Fig 1).

![doc-em-protection](/_next/static/media/EM_protection.38ee92e1.png) *Fig.1. Conveyor*.

The IP rating (International Protection) is used to determine the degree of
protection provided by an enclosure. It is a standard maintained by IEC 60529.
The IP rating is made up of 2 digits.

![doc-em-protection-table](/_next/static/media/EM_protection_table.d84b4945.png) *Fig.2. Examples of
IP classes*.

In *DriveConstructor* everything is simplified to only two protection variants:
"low" and "high".

##### Electric machine protection

* "low" is designated IP21/23, meaning protection against solid object with a
  diameter >12.5 mm and against falling water, but not splashed from all
  directions.
* "high" is designated IP54/55, meaning protection against dust and against
  water, coming from any direction.

Totally enclosed air-cooled machines are larger than open-ventilated machines.

##### FC protection

* "low" is designated IP21/31, meaning protection against solid object with a
  diameter >12.5 mm and against vertically dropping water.
* "high" is designated IP54/55, meaning protection against dust and against
  water, coming from any direction.

Operational environment (dust, moist) defines requirements to the enclosure of
the FC. FC with higher protection class in more expensive.

##### Examples

* Machine with IP23 - "drip proof" or "indoor". Predominately used in the
  refrigeration and compressor industries for their reduced frame size
  offerings. Are commonly found in environments where dirt and moisture are
  minimal. They are used in plant rooms and buildings on pumps, fans, blowers
  and compressors. Drip proof motors are the most cost effective industrial
  motor because of their design. They maximize ventilation through the motor
  providing the highest amount of heat dissipation. In turn more output power
  can be achieved in a smaller motor frame reducing cost. Typically used for
  indoor applications in relatively clean, dry locations.
* Machine with IP 54 or IP 55 (sometimes called "weather protection" or "weather
  proof") is suitable for outdoor installation with the airpath designed to
  minimize the ingress of harmful substances. Prevents the free exchange of air
  between the inside and outside of the frame, but does not make the frame
  completely air tight.

![doc-em-protection-ex](/_next/static/media/EM_protection_ex.6821db0a.png) *Fig.3. Open drip proof
motor example*.

IP21/23 machine would have better cooling so it may be \~20% lighter and more
compact than IP54/55 machine (aslo cheaper). Inspite of their higher cost
totally enclosed machines are being used increasingly in industry.

If you are not sure which protection to choose set it to "any".

# Duties and overloads
URL: /docs/textbook/components/duties-overloads

undefined

***

## title: Duties and overloads

If load of the mechanism is intermittent and follows a certain pattern, this
load can be characterized by some standard duty and overload type. Some standard
pattern according to IEC34 are presented in the chart (Fig.1). *S1*, *S2* and
*S3* patterns contain only loads up to the rated load, while *S4* patterns
contains also overload, marked *"D"* (when the load is above the rated value it
is called *overload*).

![doc-duty-cycles3](/_next/static/media/duty_cycles3.01cbef82.png) *Fig.1. Standard duty cycles*.

*Duty* is the ratio of the time at full load to the total time. In
*DriveConstructor* the range to choose from is 50...100%. *Duty cycle period* is
the time before the load pattern repeats itself. In *DriveConstructor* the range
to choose from is 0,1...100 min.

![doc-duty-cycles2](/_next/static/media/duty_cycles2.34d56ec7.png) *Fig.2. Duties of 25, 50 and
75%*.

Both *duties* and *overloads* have similar thermal effect. When the equipment is
loaded (state "ON" in Fig.3) the temperature inside the component goes up. When
load is removed (state "OFF" in Fig.3) then the temperature decreases. The rate
of the temperature increase or decrease is defined by thermal constant of this
particular component.

![doc-duty-cycles-temp](/_next/static/media/duty_cycles_temp.18643649.png) *Fig.3. Duties and
temperature inside the loaded component*.

To illustrate how overloads are defined in *DriveConstructor* Fig.4 presents
overload of 100%. The reference is rated load which is taken as 100%. The
overload of 100% means the overload amplitude is 200%.

![doc-overloads](/_next/static/media/overloads.806079e2.png) *Fig.4. Overload of 100%*.

Different components have different tolerance to overloads. Even different
electric machines have different overload tolerance; induction machines can
handle 200% overload amplitude, while PM machine usually will handle lower -
maybe 150% amplitude (=50% overload).

The limits in the components are not only thermal, but can be for example
saturation of magnetic cores in electric machines or maximum permissible current
of the switches in the FC.

Machine can thermally absorb long overloads, converter - only short ones.

## title: Sizing principles

### Main principles of the component choice

Some parameters/features of the components, such as type or topology of the
component, its protection class, cooling methods, etc can be simply set by the
user. However, there are many parameters which cannot be set freely for many of
the components since the parameters are dependent on the parameters of other
components in the drive train.

Electric machine, being an electro-mechanical converter, must be selected based
on both mechanical parameters (torques and speeds) and electrical parameters
(voltages and currents) - see Fig.1.

![doc-longest-circuit-2](/_next/static/media/longest_circuit_2.ffc459f3.png) *Fig.1*.

For the system part between electric machine and the grid the components are
selected according to the electrical parameter - voltages and currents.

* For systems without transformers:
* electric machine's voltage and current must match voltage of the frequency
  converter
* frequency converter voltage must match voltage of the grid

![doc-mot-fc-grid](/_next/static/media/mot_fc_grid.d5fb7ecd.png) *Fig. 2*.

* For systems with transformer between the grid and the frequency converter:
* electric machine's voltage and current must match voltage and current of the
  frequency converter
* frequency converter voltage and current must match LV-side voltage and current
  of the transformer
* transformer HV-side voltage must match voltage of the grid

![doc-mot-fc-trf-grid](/_next/static/media/mot_fc_trf_grid.81f08de8.png) *Fig. 3*.

For the system part between the electric machine and the mechanism the
components are selected according to mechanical parameters - torques and speeds.

* For systems without gearbox:
* electric machine's torque and speed must match torque and speed of the
  mechanism

![doc-mech-mot](/_next/static/media/mech_mot.79614c5b.png) *Fig. 4*.

* For systems with gearbox:
* gearbox torque and speed must match torque and speed of the mechanism
* electric machine's torque and speed must match torque and speed of the gearbox

![doc-mech-gear-mot](/_next/static/media/mech_gear_mot.aaad1d26.png) *Fig. 5*.

##### Matching the torques

All points of the drive system's rated torque curve should be higher than those
of the driven mechanism as shown in Fig. 6 for the different mechanisms; pump
(Fig. 6,a), wind turbine (Fig. 6,b), conveyor (Fig. 6,c,d) and winch (Fig.
6,e,f). Note than overload curves of the drive system should be above the
overload curves of the mechanisms.

![doc-winch-curves-vs-drive1](/_next/static/media/winch_curves_vs_drive1.7cf179e4.png) *(f)*

*Fig. 6. System curves vs load curves for various mechanisms/application*.

When we consider the power-speed relationships the striking difference between
the constant-torque and fan-type load is underlined. If the motor is rated for
continuous operation at the full speed, it will be very lightly loaded
(typically around 20%) at half speed, whereas with the constant torque load the
power rating will be 50% at half speed.

##### Difference of the algorithms for motor mode and generator mode

In motor mode we start from the driven mechanism, e.g. pump or conveyor, define
its rated torque (which is load for the motor) and based on this data we choose
the motor. If there is a gearbox between the mechanism and the motor, then the
load torque at the motor shaft is calculated as \[load torque]/\[gear ratio]. In
generator mode we start from the grid side and go down to the generator and
gearbox, if any.


# Variable speed in applications

Variable speed in applications description

***

title: Variable speed in applications
description: Variable speed in applications description
-------------------------------------------------------

A motor controlled by a frequency converter (FC) has become a commodity. This is
due to the number of advantages that provide the regulation of the motor speed
and, accordingly, the driven mechanism's speed. The range of applications for
variable speed drives (VSD) is very broad: general industry and utilities,
defense and aerospace, transport and power generation, household appliances,
etc. One of the possible classifications of the applications is presented in
Fig. 1.

![doc-drives-applications-new](/_next/static/media/drives_applications_new.ac9bc100.png)

*Fig. 1. Classification of the applications where VSD are used*.

In many cases electric drive systems are designed for variable-speed operation.
For example, the drive of a paper machine where high-precision synchronization
and speed control of the multiple motors is required to produce paper of a
specified quality, or a "flying shears" drive in metallurgy used to cut the
moving sheet of metal. Also, in many cases, frequency converters are installed
on existing standard induction motors.

Usually, one or more of the following goals are pursued:

##### Energy saving

In many processes, significant energy savings can be achieved if at each instant
of time the speed is optimized for the given operating point. For example, a fan
operating at 50% of the nominal speed consumes less than 15% of its rated power.

##### Process control, optimization, monitoring

Modern frequency converters have a wide range of functions that, along with
speed control of the electric motor, also allow the transfer to the top-level
automation system of all necessary information on the motor operation, remote
control and monitoring. This allows full control of the operation of the
regulated unit and, as a result, optimization of the production process as a
whole. The result can be improved quality, increased output, reduced equipment
downtime, etc.

##### Extended equipment lifetime

Smooth start-up and shutdown of the unit, provided by the FC, significantly
extends the service life of the electric motor and the driven mechanism and
increases the time between overhauls, thanks to the absence of current spikes
and mechanical shocks and jerks. In addition, the drive provides a set of motor
protections, such as protection against overheating, jamming, long overloads,
etc.

##### Ease of servicing the whole set of equipment

The frequency converter does not require much of maintenance. At the same time,
the installation of the FC allows in many cases to simplify the operation of
many components of the system. For example, in water supply systems, smooth
start-ups and shutdowns of pumping units, flow control with maintaining constant
pressure, allows to eliminate hydraulic shocks, as well as reduce pressure in
the pipeline. Due to this, the accident rate in the main line (pipe breaks,
etc.) is significantly reduced.

##### Improvement of working conditions for the personnel

In many cases, when introducing frequency converters on fans, conveyors and a
number of other mechanisms, it is possible to achieve noise reduction.


# Energy saving with the help of VSD

## title: Energy saving with the help of VSD

More than 80% of the world's population of electric motors drive the mechanisms
with a quadratic load characteristic - pumps, fans and compressors. Centrifugal
pumps, being probably the most popular pump type, are used almost everywhere -
nearly in all industries and utilities. Operation of centrifugal pump at
variable speed usually demonstrate impressive energy savings compared to
constant speed operation. The way of achieving the savings can be demonstrated
for a basic water supply system shown in Fig. 1.

![doc-pump](/_next/static/media/Pump.2f1ba9f7.png)

*Fig. 1. Water supply with throttle regulation*.

The height of the pump axis above the level of the water reservoir ("lift
height") is called the static head $$H\_st$$. When rotational speed of the
impeller of the pump is not regulated, a throttle (valve) is installed at the
pump outlet, which can change area (cross-section) of the water passage to
regulate the volume of the water supplied to the hydraulic network and the
pressure in the network. The characteristic of the pump is determined in the
coordinates of the head-flow *H-Q*. With the throttle fully open (Fig. 2a), the
head and the flow are nominal (100%) and the pump's operating point is at the
intersection of its own characteristic and the hydraulic network's (system's)
characteristic. If it is required to set the flow below $$Q\_nom$$, the throttle
partially closes and the characteristic of the hydraulic network shifts upwards
(Fig. 2b). Accordingly, the operating point moves from "1" to "2". The new flow
rate (*Q = 82%*) corresponds to a new head (*H = 64%*) in the network after the
throttle, which is defined as the head difference at point "2" and the head drop
*$$\Delta$$H*:

$$H\_t=H\_2-\Delta H\_t=108%-44%=64%$$.

The disadvantage of the flow and head regulation by the throttle (called
"throttling") is the energy loss at the throttle. The graphically useful energy
and the energy lost on the latch can be represented by rectangles in Fig. 2c. It
can be seen that even with not deep regulation of the pump flow (Q = 82% of the
nominal value), the throttle losses make up more than 40% of the power.

Another problem of throttling is reduced efficiency of the pump when the pump's
operating point is shifted from the rated due to the change in the performance
of the hydraulic network (the throttle is part of the network).

![doc-pump-chars](/_next/static/media/Pump_chars.f45ba221.png) *(a)*

![doc-pump-chars2](/_next/static/media/Pump_chars2.5a029ccc.png) *(b)*

![doc-pump-chars-energies](/_next/static/media/Pump_chars_energies.fb914d1c.png) *(c)*

*Fig. 2. Throttle control*.

The power on the pump shaft is determined by the following expression:

$$P=(g \* \rho \* h \* q)/(3.6 \* 10^6 \* \eta)$$,

where *P* is in *kW*, *g* is *gravity* ( $$g = 9.81$$ $$m/s^2$$ ), $$\rho$$ is
*density* of the pumped fluid in $$kg / m^3$$, $$\eta$$ is *efficiency* of the
pump, *h* is *head* in *m* and *q* is *flow* in $$m^3 / h$$.

Thus, lower efficiency of the pump lead to increase power consumption. Fig. 3
shows the efficiency map of the pump (lines of equal efficiency).

![doc-pump-chars-efficiency](/_next/static/media/Pump_chars_efficiency.c8645379.png)

*Fig. 3. Pump efficiency*.

When adding the frequency converter to the motor driving the pump, the throttle
can be permanently set to the fully open position. Head and flow control is
performed by changing the rotational speed of the pump's impeller. Typically, a
system with pump speed control operates in a closed loop on the feedback signal
from the pressure sensor (Fig. 4).

![doc-pump-fc](/_next/static/media/Pump_fc.3e03428b.png)

*Fig. 4. Water supply FC control*.

When the pressure in the network drops below by a value set by the operator,
which indicates an insufficient flow, the inverter automatically increases the
pump speed, which increases the flow rate and the pressure. Likewise, when the
pressure rises above a preset value, the flow rate needs to be reduced - this is
done by reducing the pump's speed.

![doc-pump-chars-fc](/_next/static/media/Pump_chars_fc.88cad313.png) *(a)*

![doc-pump-chars-energy](/_next/static/media/Pump_chars_energy.a097d20a.png) *(b)*

![doc-pump-chars-efficiency-fc](/_next/static/media/Pump_chars_efficiency_fc.e0eacbf7.png) *(c)*

*Fig. 5. Impeller speed regulation*.

In contrast to the throttle control, when the displacement of the operating
point during regulation was effected by changing the characteristics of the
hydraulic network (the throttle is part of the network), in the event of a
change in the speed of rotation of the impeller, the pump characteristic *H-Q*
is shifted. Fig. 5a shows the displacement of the characteristics of the pump,
and the operating point of the process with a decrease in speed from *n* to 82%
of *n*. Since the valve is fully open, there is no loss on it and all the
hydraulic energy generated by the pump is useful (Fig. 5b). It is noteworthy
that when the pump speed is regulated and the corresponding displacement of its
characteristic, the operating point is constantly in the zone of maximum
efficiency (Fig. 5c).


# What is an optimal system

***

## title: What is an optimal system

The system can be called *optimal* if it was benchmarked with alternative
systems on one or several criteria and showed the best score on the criteria.
The criteria can be cost (e.g. Capital Expenditures, CAPEX or Operational
Expenditures, OPEX), efficiency (e.g. at rated load or at partial loads), size
and weight, reliability, etc. The criteria should be relevant for the
application. For example, for a pump cost will be one of the most important
criteria, while weight will usually be much less important. For wind turbines
both efficiency and weight will be important, leaving cost less important.

In the proposed *Exercises* the systems should be usually designed for one
criterion. In Fig. 1 the list of criteria to choose from contains Cost,
Efficiency and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).

![doc-optimization-setting](/_next/static/media/optimization_setting.5fae4a5a.png) *Fig. 1. The
task*.

The process of selection of the variables (system structure and components with
concrete specification) to reach the best score on the chosen criterion can be
called *system optimization*.

### Benchmarking

As mentioned above, optimal system is selected in competition with alternative
solutions, therefore, some benchmarking (comparison) method in needed. The
benchmarking can be quantitative and qualitative, the latter being preferable.

##### Quantitative and qualitative comparisons

For example, motor technologies can be compared looking into loss mechanisms,
etc (Fig.2). However, numbers reflecting the components and system behavior in
different operational aspects will provide a more credible answer. One of such
measures is off course efficiency (including partial loads!). An example is
shown in Fig.3.

![doc-qualitative-comparison-1](/_next/static/media/qualitative_comparison_1.5adc5806.png)

*Fig. 2. Qualitative comparison of motor technology*.

![doc-comparing-eff-curves](/_next/static/media/comparing_eff_curves.f7294e3c.png) *Fig. 3.
Comparing efficiencies*.

It is relatively easy to draw conclusions on which system is best (optimal) for
the application when there is only one criterion, e.g. cost. It is more
challenging to benchmark on several criteria. In such case Spider Diagram can be
the right tool to visualize the results (Fig.4).

![doc-benchmarking](/_next/static/media/benchmarking.6b6e0de7.png) *Fig. 4. Quantitative
comparison*.

### Life Cycle Cost (LCC)

LCC is one of the popular criteria for benchmarking. Goodness of the EM for an
application can be defined by cost of ownership which comprises purchase cost,
cost of running (COR) and cost of not running (CONR). COR is cost of consumed
energy which is defined by efficiency. CONR is defined by MTBF (reliability)
which gives prediction of how often the machine will fail. CONR would include
cost of repair and cost of stopped production. CONR is not included in
*DriveConstructor*.

ownership*.


# Frequency converter influence on the grid

***

## title: Frequency converter influence on the grid

Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) means the ability of devices and technical
systems to function normally under the influence of electromagnetic fields and
conductivity interference on them and not to create unacceptable interference to
other objects. When it comes to frequency converters, there are basically two
types of negative influence of the converter on the surrounding equipment
(Fig.1):

* Conductivity emissions into the network
* harmonics
* megahertz (radio-frequency, RF) interference
* Emissions radiated through air:
* through the converter housing
* from power and control cables

![doc-emc-emissions](/_next/static/media/emc_emissions.39c227d7.png)

*Fig. 1. Emissions from the drive system*.

### Harmonics created by the frequency converter

The frequency converter is a non-linear load for the supply network and the
current and the voltage at FC input are not sinusoidal. Fig. 2 shows typical
forms of current and voltage at the input of the 400 V, 75 kW FC with an
uncontrolled 6-pulse rectifier. The current wave is usually distorted much more
than the voltage.

![doc-fc-input-i](/_next/static/media/fc_input_i.8a8466b4.png) *(a)*

![doc-fc-input-u](/_next/static/media/fc_input_u.a447907b.png) *(b)*

*Fig. 2. Waveforms of current (a) and voltage (b)*.

![doc-harmonics-u](/_next/static/media/harmonics_u.9d1ecea5.png) *(b)*

*Fig. 3. Fourier transformation of current (a) and voltage (b)*.

### Measures of current and voltage distortion

The common measure of the harmonic distortion of the current wave is "total
harmonic distortion (current)" - THD(i):

```math
K_I=\sqrt  \frac{\sum_{i\neq0} I_n^2 }{I_1^2}
```

A similar factor is used for voltage - THD(u):

```math
K_U=\sqrt  \frac{\sum_{i\neq0} U_n^2 }{U_1^2}
```

For example, for the waveform in Fig.2 the values of $$K\_I$$ and $$K\_U$$ are
40.2% and 6.6%, respectively. Sometimes in the expressions for the sinusoidal
distortion coefficients in the denominator the non-effective value of the first
harmonic ($$U\_1$$ or $$I\_1$$), but r.m.s. value ($$U$$ or $$I$$).

### Negative effects of harmonics

* Equipment misoperation and failure
* e.g. failure due to overheating of transformers, motors and cables, failure of
  capacitors because of resonance, failure due to insulation deterioration.
* Inconsistent meter reading
* Need for oversizing neutrals, transformers, generators
* Extra losses/Inefficiencies/power factor penalties

### What defines how strong the distortion is

Level of distortion is defined by the topology of the FC and the used filters
(if any) as well as stiffness of the grid. To define the "stiffness" of the
supply grid, the short-circuit current $$I\_c$$ is calculated by hypothetically
placing short-circuit at the supply terminals. The stiffness of the supply must
be calculated in relation to the load current, therefore, the stiffness is
defined by a ration called short-circuit ratio (SCR): $$SCR=Ic\_/I\_L$$, where
$$I\_L$$ - fundamental frequency component of the load current.

The stiffer the grid will be (the higher the SCR) the more harmonics the FC is
usually allowed to inject into the grid.

Influence of the topology and the filters is presented in a few diagrams below.
Standard uncontrolled 6-pulse rectifier with a choke as the input filter
(Fig.4,a) produced quite a lot of current distortion (Fig.4,b).

![doc-6p-with-choke](/_next/static/media/6p_with_choke.d65abd4b.png) *(a)*

![doc-thdi28](/_next/static/media/THDi28.cdf2a204.png) *(b)*

*Fig. 4. 6-pulse rectifier with a choke; system topology (a) and current
waveform with THD(i)=28% (b).*

12-pulse scheme with 3-winding transformer (Fig.5,a) reduces harmonics injected
into the grid (Fig. 5,b) compared to 6-pulse scheme with 2-winding transformer.

## title: Frequency converter influence on the electric machine

### High frequency effects

Voltage rise time of IGBT can be within 0.1-0.2 microseconds. When powering the
FC from the 400 V mains, the voltage in the DC link is about 540 V, so the rate
of voltage rise in the IGBT can be up to 5 kV/$$\mu$$s. Influence of the
sequence of pulse fronts with du/dt of 5 kV/$$\mu$$ on the system
"FC-cable-machine-reducer-driven mechanism" is in many ways similar to the
action of a sinusoidal voltage of the same amplitude, but with a frequency of
the order of several megahertz. That is why the negative effects caused by the
high switching are often called "high-frequency effects". The HF effects result
in:

* Increased losses in windings and core of the machine due to non-sinusoidal
  voltages and currents
* Ageing and degradation of insulation, shorter lifetime of the insulation
* Degradation of bearings

The effects affecting the insulation and the one affecting the bearings are
briefly presented below.

### Traveling waves and overvoltage

In practice, the length of the cable between the FC and the machine can reach
hundreds of meters and even up to a few kilometers. Due to the difference in
impedance of the cable $$Z\_0$$ and the machines winding $$Z\_m$$, voltage pulses
get reflected from both ends of the cable. As the result, there appear waves
travelling between the FC and the machine. At different instants of time, waves
can either compensate each other (when pulses have different polarity) or add up
(when polarity is the same). When the direct and reflected waves are combined,
as shown in Fig. 1, the total pulse at the terminals of the machine can reach
the value at which the insulation may break down.

![doc-reflection](/_next/static/media/reflection.46a16eab.png)

*Fig. 1. Superposition of voltage pulses at the terminals of the machine*.

One way to estimate the peak voltage at the terminals of the machine with
allowance for wave superposition is
$$U\_p=U\_d\left(1+\frac{Z_m-Z_0}{Z_m+Z_0}\right)$$, where $$U\_d$$ is the
amplitude of the voltage pulses at the converter output, equal to the voltage in
the DC link. When the cable gets longer, $$Z\_0$$ decreases. In practice $$U\_p$$
is within $$(1.5\ldots1.9)U\_d$$.

Fig. 2,a shows the measured voltage at the output of the FC and at the terminals
of the machine (only part of the pulse is shown). For clarity, the impulses are
superimposed on each other. The effect of superposition of forward and backward
waves on the terminals of the machine resulting in voltage oscillations is
obvious.

![doc-impuls-2signals](/_next/static/media/impuls_2signals.ce409c1c.png) *(a)*

![doc-dudt-pulses](/_next/static/media/dudt_pulses.7fccc9d0.png) *(b)*

*Fig. 2. Voltage pulses: the leading edge of the pulse at the output of the FC
and at the terminals of the machine (a), both edges of the pulse at the
terminals of the machine (b)*.

### du/dt-effect

Sharp edges/fronts of the PWM pulses and capacitances in the winding lead to
uneven voltage distribution inside the winding and create inter-turn voltage
spikes as shown in Fig 3,a. This leads to partial discharges in the insulation
(Fig.3,b). Constant partial discharges lead to aging of insulation and
subsequent destruction (breakdown).

![doc-dudt-effect](/_next/static/media/dudt_effect.a8c68750.png) *(a)*

![doc-ins-breakdown-e](/_next/static/media/ins_breakdown_E.dd1e2076.png) *(b)*

*Fig. 3. du/dt-effect: origins (a) and consequences (b)*.

### Bearing currents

The PWM modulation of the output voltage leads to a common-mode (CM) voltage. In
Fig. 4 switching pattern is shown, and it can be observed how the common-mode
(CM) voltage is generated. This voltage is obtained by adding the three voltages
resulting from the three inverter legs. Having the DC-link mid-point as a
reference, the voltages Va, Vb and Vc can either be +Vdc/2 or -Vdc/2, where Vdc
is the DC-link voltage. As a result, depending on the state of the switches, the
common mode voltage can take one of the values $$\pm$$Vdc/2 and $$\pm$$Vdc/6.

![doc-common-mode-voltage](/_next/static/media/common_mode_voltage.e93aedc5.png)

*Fig. 4. Common-mode voltage*.

CM voltages lead to appearance of CM high-frequency currents flow through
complex circuits/paths some of which are presented in Fig.5. The HF currents
circulating through the bearings of the machine (called "bearing currents") can
lead to premature bearing failures. Another example of the negative impacts is
HF leakage currents through ground cables which can interfere with control
cables.

# Inertia in the drive train
URL: /docs/textbook/systems/inertia

***

## title: Inertia in the drive train

All moving (rotating) parts of a drive train are characterized with their own
inertia. There can be calculated a combined inertia of several mechanically
connected parts - for example *"rotor + coupling + driven mechanism"*. To
calculate combined inertia of the drive train without gearboxes inertias of the
drive train's parts are simply summed up. A gearbox changes the inertia in the
system and, from the operation point of view the gearbox may play both a
positive and a negative role. Possible system level considerations are presented
below with the help of the four cases related to operation of a tidal turbine
and a winch. The drive trains in the four cases include a gearbox, an electric
machine and a brake (Fig.1).

![doc-tt-with-gear](/_next/static/media/TT_with_gear.eb36db87.png) *(a)*

![doc-winch-with-gear](/_next/static/media/winch_with_gear.600d9dc9.png) *(b)*

*Fig. 1. Mechanical drive trains for a tidal turbine (a) and a winch (b)*.

### Case 1. Critical acceleration of a tidal turbine at grid loss

In case of grid loss the turbine should be braked. Before the mechanical brake
is applied, the propeller will accelerate extremely fast if the system inertia
is low. When analyzing the inertia in a system with a gearbox one could divide
the train into two "parts" or "sides": the "first" - where the force of the
water stream is applied, and the "second" - which is counteracting the force.
The gearbox usually belongs to the "second" side. Since in our case the action
is performed by the water acting on the propeller trying to accelerate it,
therefore, it is useful to look at the system "from the propeller side" as in
Fig.2.

![doc-tt-with-gear2](/_next/static/media/TT_with_gear2.a112201e.png)

*Fig. 2. Torques and inertia seen by the propeller.*

When the electric machine (generator) is in "off"-state e.g. due to a failure
and cannot produce any torque outbalancing the force acting on the blades,
acceleration can be limited only by the dynamic torque, corresponding to the
system inertia "seen" by the propeller. The dynamic torque is defined by the
inertia:

```math
T_d=J\left(\frac{d\omega}{dt}\right)
```

The propeller "sees" the gearbox and the generator as a one whole with the total
inertia of $$J=J\_p+J\_g=J\_p+i^2J\_r$$, where $$J\_p$$ is moment of inertia of the
propeller itself and *i* is gear ratio.

It can be seen that the gearbox plays a positive role as it increases the
inertia "seen" by the propeller and as the consequence it increases the dynamic
torque resisting the propeller acceleration:

```math
T_d=\left(J_p+i^2J_r\right)\left(\frac{d\omega_1}{dt}\right)\text{, where }\omega_1=n/9.55
```

This positive effect is higher for higher gear ratio.

### Case 2. Stream turbulence in normal operation of tidal turbine

Underwater waves hitting the blades create stresses on the elements of the
mechanical drive train. Low system inertia "seen by the propeller" will be an
advantage as it lets the generator "to give a slack" to absorb the "hit" by
letting the propeller to accelerate a bit and then bring it back to the right
speed. However, the torque that the accelerating blades will experience is the
sum of the electromagnetic torque applied by the generator and the mechanical
dynamic torque: $$T=T\_e+T\_d$$, where the dynamic torque is

```math
T_d=\left(J_p+i^2J_r\right)\left(\frac{d\omega_1}{dt}\right)
```

Dynamic torque gets higher when the gear ratio increases. It will increase
"stiffness" of the system and will lead to higher stresses on the mechanical
components. Therefore, a gearbox with a high gear ratio plays a negative role.

### Case 3. Accelerating and braking the winch with the electric machine

Permanent acceleration and braking is typical for example in active heave
compensation winch deploying ROV, which is moving with the waves.

*Fig. 3. Torques and inertia seen by the motor (a) and the winch (b)*.

When accelerating or braking the system, the electric machine, being the "actor"
"sees" the winch and the gear as a whole (Fig.3,a). The machine should provide
the torque high enough to overcome the total system inertia. The system inertia
is made by the winch drum inertia "seen through the gearbox" and own inertia of
the electric machine (rotor inertia): $$J=J\_g+J\_r$$.

The winch drum inertia "seen through the gearbox" is given by the winch drum's
own inertia (defined by mass and radius of the drum) and the gear ratio i (taken
in power 2): $$J\_g=\frac{J_w}{i^2}$$, where $$i=\frac{n_2}{n_1}$$.

*We assume that i>1 and electric machine speed higher than winch speed*.

So, the total inertia the machine is to overcome when accelerating is
$$J\_g=\frac{J_w}{i^2}+J\_r$$

It means that when the gear ratio is high (order of 1:100) it is practically
only the machine's own inertia that matters. For acceleration and deceleration
it is also beneficial to have low torque requirement for the machine, which is
provided by the gearbox: $$T\_2=\frac{T_1}{n}$$

So, the gearbox plays a positive role.

### Case 4. Winch braking when the electric machine fails

When the electric machine fails (e.g. short-circuit) the winch should be braked
with the mechanical brake. Analyzing the problem it is correct to "see" the
system from the winch side since the brake located at the winch drum is the
"actor" applying the braking force (Fig. 3,b). The brake "sees" the gearbox and
the machine as a whole with inertia equal to $$J=J\_w+J\_g=J\_w+i^2J\_r$$.

"Dynamic" braking power is defined by the dynamic torque:

```math
P_d=T_d*\omega_1=\left(J_w+i^2J_r\right)\left({d\omega_1}/{dt}\right)\omega_1\text{, where }\omega_1=n/9.55
```

The required braking power $$P\_d$$ will be sizing the brake. So, the gearbox
plays a negative role, increasing the inertia.

### Conclusions

Having gone through the four cases we can conclude that there is always a
trade-off between positive and negative sides and the system designer should
look for the optimal gear ratio.

***

Note that parts of the gearbox will also always contribute to the inertia. We
neglected gearbox's own inertia and energy losses in the above for simplicity.
